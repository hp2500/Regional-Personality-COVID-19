At the outset of the year, we told you our goal was to be GAAP \\nprofitable by the end of 2017. Throughout the year, we executed a set of important changes to our business that \\nenabled us to reach our target, realizing $5 million of GAAP net income in the fourth quarter. Some of those \\nchanges were difficult, but they were necessary to set up our business for future growth. Our discipline allowed \\nus to gain control over the main drivers of our business, and today, we now have a rationalized cost structure, \\nstable credit and capital markets strategies, growing products and markets, and a clear plan to serve our small \\nbusiness customers. Along with a favorable external environment, we now have a solid platform from which to \\ndrive sustainable, long-term growth.    \\n \\nIn the 10 years building this business, I have never been more excited for what the future holds for OnDeck than \\nI am today. In August 2017, we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of our first loan to our first customer. Now, a \\ndecade later, we are the clear leader in online small business lending, having provided more than $8 billion of \\ncapital to 80,000 small business customers in three countries around the world. And, we are just getting started. \\n  \\n\\n \\n \\nFrom a growth perspective, we have an enormous opportunity to improve the features, flexibility, and distribution \\nof our term loans and lines of credit and we plan to add more products to our solution set in the coming years. \\nAnd, from an operational leverage perspective, we have opportunities to improve our portfolio management and \\ncollections, level of automation, and productivity.  \\n \\nOnDeck’s mission is to create innovative lending experiences and financial solutions to help small businesses \\nsucceed. Our aim has always been to build a company that fits the needs of our customers and enables our \\nsmall business customers to achieve success – however they might define it.  \\n \\nOnDeck combines the innovation and speed of a financial technology company with the human touch of a local \\nbank. By investing in both the technology and the people that drive our business, OnDeck has created a \\ndifferentiated small business lending experience that is simple and fast. We have brought technology, \\nautomation, and advanced analytics to small business lending, but the human aspect of our business has been \\nand will continue to be vital to our success. We are finding great benefits to our customers and our business by \\nbringing a human complement to our sales, underwriting, customer service, and collections efforts. I believe \\nsmall businesses come back and continue to borrow from us because our customer experience is unmatched in \\nthe market. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEven 10 years into building our business and the evolution of online lending, traditional small business lending \\ncontinues to be slow and intimidating for those who actually receive a loan, and many creditworthy business \\nowners are still underserved by traditional lending institutions.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n2\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n \\nThe market opportunity remains compelling. A recent Electronic Transactions Association Small Business \\nOwner research study found that, of the small business owners considering taking out a loan in the next 12 \\nmonths, only 38% will consider an online lender, leaving plenty of room for expansion. However, according to \\nthe same study, 98% of borrowers who have tried an online lender are likely to take out another loan from an \\nonline lending company – once borrowers experience the convenience of online lending, they rarely want to go \\nback to the traditional lending process. Further, according to our own market research, we have a substantial \\nopportunity to leverage the relationship we have with our existing customers to provide them more products and \\nservices over time.  \\n \\nI am eager to share below some of the key successes of 2017 and how we are looking to grow the business and \\nearnings in 2018.  \\n \\nOnDeck’s Transformative 2017 \\n \\nIn 2017, we made a strategic decision to accelerate our path to GAAP profitability. Over the course of the year, \\nwe took significant actions to strengthen our financial profile by tightening credit management, rationalizing our \\ncost structure and solidifying our foundation from which to drive long-term profitability and growth. We delivered \\nsolid execution against these priorities and achieved a record $5 million of GAAP net income for the fourth \\nquarter of 2017, over $40 million better than the prior year.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nWe also delivered notable improvements across all key performance metrics, including achieving our highest \\nEffective Interest Yield since 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2017. We also lowered our Provision Rate, 15+ Day \\nDelinquency Ratio and Net Charge-off Rate to the lowest levels of 2017 in the fourth quarter.   \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nTo realign our cost structure, we reduced our annual expense run rate by more than $45 million relative to the \\nfourth quarter of 2016. While we made some very difficult choices to produce these savings, we believe that we \\ndid this without compromising our ability to drive responsible and profitable growth. Our organization is nimbler \\nand leaner, and we are now executing projects with a greater level of focus than we did before.  \\n \\nWe also took substantial steps in 2017 to reduce the variability of our operating results as we head into 2018 \\nand beyond. Our channel mix has now remained fairly stable for the past several years, and we expect that will \\ngenerally continue in 2018. Our capital markets strategy also returned to a traditional balance sheet model – we \\nwill still use OnDeck Marketplace® opportunistically, but as 2017 progressed we sold fewer loans to investors, \\nas the company earns higher returns from holding loans on balance sheet.  \\n \\n \\nWe pulled back on originations in the first half of the year to ensure we solved some of the credit challenges we \\nexperienced in 2016, but were able to begin growing originations again in the second half of the year in a more \\ndisciplined manner. We also improved portfolio quality and unit economics – personal credit and OnDeck \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n3\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nScores® ended the year at near historic high levels, with over half of our portfolio having personal credit scores \\nover 700. Our loan offers became more conservative in terms of amount and duration, and we increased our \\npricing as base rates started to rise. These steps ensured that our second half growth in originations had \\nattractive unit economics.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nOne area we continued to invest in 2017, even as we generally pulled back on expenses, was our OnDeck-as-\\na-Service program. A key milestone was extending our industry-leading partnership capabilities with JPMorgan \\nChase. This is a key investment area for 2018, and we are confident in OnDeck-as-a-Service’s ability to drive \\nlong-term growth. \\n \\nOnDeck in 2018: Driving Responsible Growth  \\n \\nAs we move into 2018, we are focused on driving double digit loan growth and scaling responsibly. We will \\ncontinue strengthening our credit management and loss mitigation capabilities while broadening our product \\nreach and appeal, growing our international businesses and optimizing our unit economics. Our strategy is \\ngrounded in making decisions that will drive earnings growth and ultimately enable us to create long-term value \\nfor our shareholders. That means discipline around reaching the following goals: 1) growing responsibly, with a \\nprofitability floor that increases over time, 2) reducing variability in operating results, and 3) executing our capital \\nallocation strategy.  \\n \\nFrom a credit perspective, we intend to capitalize on opportunities to further improve decision-making, both \\noperationally and through enhancements to our OnDeck Score and related models. In addition, over the course \\nof the year, we plan to roll out enhanced credit bureau reporting, introduce troubled debt restructuring \\ncapabilities and improve recovery performance to achieve our target 6 to 7 percent provision rate range. There \\nis substantial economic leverage through the operational side of portfolio management and loss mitigation in our \\nbusiness – we see just as much opportunity there in 2018 as we do from improving our credit models and \\nunderwriting capabilities.  \\n \\nOn the product front, we are scheduled to release new features for our term loan and line of credit offerings to \\nbroaden their overall appeal and deliver a superior experience for our customers. To capitalize on this line of \\ncredit opportunity, we expect to roll out new amortization options and increase the availability in our indirect \\nchannels while substantially lowering our line of credit funding cost. In 2018, OnDeck will also be the first \\ncompany to offer true real-time access to capital through the debit card network in North America. We \\nestablished a partnership with Ingo Money and Visa to enable real-time funding of loans to small businesses via \\ntheir existing debit cards, powered by VISA Direct. We also expect to announce a new small business lending \\nproduct by the end of the year. These initiatives should delight our customers while increasing customer \\nconversion and the depth of their relationship with OnDeck.  \\n \\nWith banks increasingly looking to digitize their originations processes, our conviction in the opportunity to \\nmarket our OnDeck-as-a-Service platform to banks has only increased. We will invest in our technology and our \\nmanagement team in this area to capture the significant growth opportunity that exists. In August 2017, we \\nannounced an extension of our strategic partnership with JPMorgan Chase, and we are on track to announce \\nour second major bank partnership later this year.  \\n \\n \\nOur international operations are also gaining momentum. We will continue investing in our Australian and \\nCanadian lending businesses, which are growing faster than the US lending business with strong gross \\nmargins. We are seeing lower levels of credit loss on similar types of borrowers in Canada and Australia when \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n4\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\ncompared to the US, and we have substantial opportunity to optimize our funding costs and structure in these \\nmarkets.   \\n \\nCapitalizing on a Favorable External Environment \\n \\nIn 2018, we expect to benefit from the secular trend towards online lending as well as the broader economic \\nenvironment. Small businesses are among the top beneficiaries of recent tax legislation with a reduced \\ncorporate tax rate, accelerated asset depreciation, and an increased ability to shield their income from taxes for \\npass-through entities. And, not surprisingly, optimism is high. The National Federation of Independent Business \\n(NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index is at historic highs with key components of the index signaling greater \\nsmall business confidence and certainty in the economy – 66% of small business owners reported capital \\noutlays, a net 22% reported plans to raise worker compensation, and expectations of real sales growth is up to a \\nnet 28%. As the President and CEO of NFIB, Juanita Duggan said, “Main Street is on fire again.” Finally, low \\nlevels of unemployment mean that many of our customers are seeing robust demand for their goods and \\nservices.  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nNot only is the economic and regulatory backdrop strong for small business lending, but the competitive \\nenvironment is looking more favorable as well, after several years of heightened competitive intensity. The \\ncompetitive shakeout in our industry during 2017 helped stabilize our environment. Overall, market participants \\nare operating more rationally in terms of acquisition spend and offer quality. At the same time, we have become \\nmore efficient with our marketing spend, as we grew originations in the second half of 2017 despite lower sales \\nand marketing expenses.  \\n \\nWell-Positioned to Deliver Strong Profitable Growth  \\n \\nIn the second half of 2017, we refined our long-term strategic plan, re-grounding our vision and strategic focus. \\nIn 2018 and beyond, OnDeck will continue to focus on better serving our customers, improving our leadership in \\ntechnology and credit decisioning, and driving profitable growth to deliver more value to our shareholders.  \\n  \\nOur vision is to be the first choice lending partner for underserved small businesses and to be a market leader \\nwith our OnDeck-as-a-Service platform.

Business\\n\\n Our Company\\n\\nWe are a leading platform for online small business lending. We continue to transform small business lending by making \\nit efficient and convenient for small businesses to access capital. Our platform touches every aspect of the customer life cycle, \\nincluding customer acquisition, sales, scoring and underwriting, funding, and servicing and collections. Enabled by our proprietary \\ntechnology and analytics, we aggregate and analyze thousands of data points from dynamic, disparate data sources, and the \\nrelationships among those attributes, to assess the creditworthiness of small businesses rapidly and accurately. The data points \\ninclude customer bank activity shown on their bank statements, business and personal credit bureau reports, government filings, \\ntax and census data. In addition, in certain instances we also analyze reputation and social data. Small businesses can apply for a \\nterm loan or line of credit, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on our website in minutes and, using our proprietary OnDeck Score®, \\nwe can make a funding decision immediately and transfer funds as fast as the same day. We have originated more than $8 billion \\nof loans since we made our first loan in 2007. \\n\\nIn 2017, 2016 and 2015, we originated $2.1 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion of loans, respectively. Our originations \\nhave been supported by a diverse and scalable set of funding sources, including committed debt facilities, securitization facilities \\nand OnDeck Marketplace, our whole loan sale platform for institutional investors. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded gross \\nrevenue of $351.0 million, $291.3 million and $254.8 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 20%, 14% and \\n61%, respectively. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net loss attributable to On Deck Capital, Inc. common stockholders was $11.5 \\nmillion, $83.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, our loss from operations was $13.6 million, $85.1 million and $1.9 million, \\nrespectively, and our Adjusted Net Income (Loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.0 million, $(67.0) million and $10.3 \\nmillion respectively. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-\\nGAAP Financial Measures for a discussion and reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to net loss. As of December 31, 2017, our \\ntotal assets were $996.0 million and the Unpaid Principal Balance on our loans outstanding was $936.2 million.\\n\\nWe were incorporated in the state of Delaware on May 4, 2006. We operate from our headquarters in New York, New York \\nand also have offices in Arlington, Virginia, Denver, Colorado, Sydney, Australia and Toronto, Canada. Additional information \\nabout us is available on our website at http://www.ondeck.com. The information on our website is not incorporated herein by \\nreference and is not a part of this report.\\n\\nOnDeck, the OnDeck logo, OnDeck Score, OnDeck Marketplace and other trademarks or service marks of OnDeck appearing \\nin this report are the property of OnDeck. Trade names, trademarks and service marks of other companies appearing in this report \\nare the property of their respective holders. We have generally omitted the ® and TM designations, as applicable, for the trademarks \\nused in this report.\\n\\nOur Market and Solution\\n\\nThe small business lending market is vast and underserved. According to the FDIC, of business loans in the United States \\nwith originations under $250,000, there were $207 billion in outstanding business loans at June 30, 2017 across 24.7 million loans.\\n\\nWe offer small businesses a suite of financing options with our term loans and lines of credit that can meet the needs of \\nsmall businesses throughout their life cycle. Since we made our first loan in 2007, we have originated more than $8 billion of \\nloans across more than 700 industries in all 50 U.S. states, Canada and Australia. The top five states in which we, or our issuing \\nbank partner, originated loans in 2017 were California, Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois, representing approximately 14%, \\n9%, 9%, 7% and 4% of our total loan originations, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, our customers have a median annual \\nrevenue of approximately $631,000, with 90% of our customers having between $162,106 and $3.8 million in annual revenue, \\nand have been in business for a median of 8 years, with 90% in business between 2 and 30 years. During 2017, the average size \\nof a term loan we made was approximately $57,000 and the average size of a line of credit extended to our customers was \\napproximately $23,000.\\n\\nWe believe our scale offers significant benefits including lower customer acquisition costs, access to a broader dataset, better \\nunderwriting decisions and a lower cost of capital compared to certain smaller online lending businesses.\\n\\nWe believe our customers choose us because we provide the following key benefits sought by small business borrowers:\\n \\n\\n• Tailored Solutions. We offer small businesses a suite of financing choices with our term loans and lines of credit that we \\nbelieve can be tailored to effectively address small businesses\\' particular funding needs. We believe that small businesses \\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nprefer to work with providers with whom they can build long-term relationships and that the range of our offerings makes \\nus an ideal lending partner. Our term loans are available from $5,000 up to $500,000 with maturities of three to 36 months \\nand our lines of credit range from $6,000 to $100,000 and are generally repayable within six months of the date of most \\nrecent draw. We believe this provides a wider range of term lengths, pricing alternatives and repayment options than any \\nother online small business lender. We also report back to several business credit bureaus, which can help small businesses \\nbuild their business credit.  \\n\\n• Simple. Small businesses can submit an application on our website in as little as minutes. We are able to provide many \\nloan applicants with an immediate decision and, if approved, transfer funds as fast as the same day. Because we require \\nno in-person meetings, collect comprehensive information electronically and have an intuitive online application form, \\nwe have been able to significantly increase the convenience and efficiency of the application process without burdensome \\ndocumentation requirements.\\n\\n• Human. Being “human” is about understanding, having empathy for our customers and treating them with respect. We \\nemploy a hybrid approach to delivering a \"human\" experience, where people and technology complement one another.  \\nOur internal sales force and customer service representatives provide assistance throughout the application process and \\nthe life of the loan. Our U.S-based representatives support customers in the U.S., and currently also Canada, and our \\nseparate Sydney-based representatives support customers in Australia. Our representatives are available Monday through \\nSaturday before, during and after regular business hours to accommodate the busy schedules of small business owners. \\nOur website enables our customers to complete the loan application process online, but they may also elect to mail, fax \\nor email us their application and related documentation. We believe that our inclusion of the human element differentiates \\nus from many digital lenders that attempt to complete transactions with no human interaction as well as from banks that, \\nwe believe, have a poor history of customer service and satisfaction.\\n\\nOur Competitive Strengths\\n\\nWe believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us and serve as barriers for others seeking to enter our market:\\n \\n\\n• Significant Scale. We have originated over $8 billion in loans across more than 700 industries since we made our first \\nloan in 2007 and maintain a proprietary database of more than 18 million small businesses. \\n\\n• Proprietary Small Business Credit Evaluation. We use data analytics and technology to optimize our business operations \\nand the customer experience. Our proprietary data and analytics engine and the OnDeck Score provide us with significant \\nvisibility and predictability to assess the creditworthiness of small businesses and allow us to better serve more customers \\nacross more industries. With each loan application, each originated loan and each payment received, our dataset expands \\nand our OnDeck Score improves. We are able to lend to more small businesses than if we relied on personal credit scores \\nalone. We are also able to use our proprietary data and analytics engine to pre-qualify customers and market to those \\ncustomers we believe are predisposed to take a loan and have a higher likelihood of approval.  When we believe it is \\nwarranted, we may also utilize our hybrid approach which utilizes our judgmental underwriting to help tailor the right \\nfinancial solution for our customers.\\n\\n• End-to-End Integrated Technology Platform. We built our integrated platform specifically to meet the financing needs \\nof small businesses. Our platform touches every aspect of the customer life cycle, including customer acquisition, sales, \\nscoring and underwriting, funding, and servicing and collections. This purpose-built infrastructure is enhanced by robust \\nfraud protection, multiple layers of security and proprietary application programming interfaces. It enables us to deliver \\na superior customer experience and facilitates agile decision making. We use our platform to underwrite, process and \\nservice all of our small business loans regardless of distribution channel.\\n\\n• Diversified Distribution Channels. We are enhancing distribution capabilities through diversified distribution channels, \\nincluding direct marketing, strategic partnerships and funding advisors. Our direct marketing includes direct mail, \\noutbound calling, social media and other online marketing channels.  Our strategic partners, including banks, payment \\nprocessors and small business-focused service providers, offer us access to their base of small business customers, and \\ndata that can be used to enhance our targeting capabilities. We also have relationships with a large network of funding \\nadvisors, including businesses that provide loan brokerage services, which drive distribution and aid brand awareness. \\nOur internal sales force contacts potential customers, responds to inbound inquiries from potential customers, and is \\navailable to assist all customers throughout the application process.\\n\\n• Singular Focus and Visibility. We are passionate about small businesses. Since we began lending in 2007, we have focused \\nexclusively on assessing and delivering credit to small businesses. We believe this passion, focus and small business \\ncredit expertise provides us with significant competitive advantages, including deep insight into small businesses and \\ntheir financing needs.  Our partnerships with well-known companies such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, \\nor JPM, Intuit Inc. and others also help increase our visibility and validate our brand.  As an NYSE listed company, we \\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nare required to meet high standards of transparency and financial reporting as well as to satisfy numerous other legal \\nrequirements.  We believe the combination of these factors strengthens our position as we compete for customers. \\n\\n• High Customer Satisfaction and Repeat Customer Base. Our strong value proposition has been validated by our customers. \\nWe achieved an overall Net Promoter Score of 79 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 based on our internal \\nsurvey of U.S. customers in all three of our distribution channels. The Net Promoter Score is a widely used index ranging \\nfrom negative 100 to 100 that measures customer loyalty. Our score places us at the upper end of customer satisfaction \\nratings and compares favorably to the average Net Promoter Score of 35 for the financial services industry. We have also \\nconsistently achieved an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. We believe that high customer satisfaction has played \\nan important role in repeat borrowing by our customers. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, 52%, 53% and 57%, respectively, of \\nloan originations were by repeat term loan customers, who either replaced their existing term loan with a new, usually \\nlarger, term loan or took out a new term loan after paying off their existing OnDeck term loan in full. Repeat customers \\ngenerally demonstrate improvements in key metrics such as revenue and bank balance when they return for an additional \\nloan.  From our 2015 customer cohort, customers who took at least three loans grew their revenue and bank balance, \\nrespectively, on average by 37% and 50% from their initial loan to their third loan. Similarly, from our 2016 customer \\ncohort, customers who took at least three loans grew their revenue and bank balance, respectively, on average by 35%\\nand 42%. Approximately 27.7% percent of our origination volume from repeat customers in 2017 was due to unpaid \\nprincipal balances rolled from existing loans directly into new loans. Each repeat customer seeking another term loan \\nmust meet the following standards:\\n\\n• the business must be approximately 50% paid down on its existing loan;\\n\\n• the business must be current on its outstanding OnDeck loan with no material delinquency history; and\\n\\n• the business must be fully re-underwritten and determined to be of adequate credit quality.\\n\\n• Durable Business Model. Since we began lending in 2007, we have successfully operated our business through both \\nstrong and weak economic environments. Our real-time data, short duration loans, automated daily and weekly collections, \\nrisk management capabilities and unit economics enable us to react rapidly to changing market conditions.\\n\\n• Differentiated Funding Platform. We source capital through multiple channels, including debt facilities, securitizations \\nand OnDeck Marketplace, a whole loan sale platform for institutional investors. This diversity provides us with a mix of \\nscalable funding sources, long-term capital commitments and access to flexible funding for growth. In addition, because \\nwe contribute a portion of the capital for each loan we fund via our debt facilities and securitizations, we are able to align \\ninterests with our investors. \\n\\nOur Strategy for Growth\\n\\nOur vision is to become the first choice lender to underserved small businesses, and to accomplish this, we intend to:\\n\\n• Expand Offerings. We will continue developing financing solutions and enhancements for underserved small businesses \\nthroughout their life cycle. We offer lines of credit with limits up to $100,000 and term loans up to $500,000 with terms \\nup to 36-months. In 2018, we plan to launch a real-time funding option to small businesses via their debit cards through \\nour agreements with Ingo Money and Visa. In addition, based on successful testing in 2017, we expect to introduce other \\nnew features to make our offerings more relevant and flexible. Our goal in expanding our offerings is to provide more \\ncomprehensive solutions for our current customers as well as to attract more new OnDeck customers. We regularly \\nevaluate our product range and explore new ideas including variations of existing loans through test pilot programs before \\nnew loans or loan enhancements are fully introduced. \\n\\n• Continue to Acquire Customers Through Direct Marketing and Sales. We plan to continue efficient investment in direct \\nmarketing and sales to add new customers and increase our brand awareness. Through this channel, we make contact \\nwith prospective customers utilizing direct mail, outbound calling, social media and online marketing. As our dataset \\nexpands, we will continue to pre-qualify and market to those customers we believe are predisposed to take a loan and \\nhave a higher likelihood of approval. We have seen success from this strategy as the Direct Marketing channel contributed \\nmore than any other channel, in terms of absolute dollars, to our originations in 2017 and over the same period achieved \\nlower customer acquisition costs on a per dollar funded basis. \\n\\n• Broaden Distribution Capabilities Through Strategic Partners and Funding Advisors. Through our Strategic Partner \\nchannel, we are introduced to prospective customers by third parties that serve or otherwise have access to the small \\nbusiness community in the regular course of their business. Strategic partners conduct their own marketing activities \\nwhich may include email marketing, leveraging existing business relationships and direct mail. Strategic partners include, \\namong others, small business-focused service providers, other financial institutions, financial and accounting solution \\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nproviders, payment processors, independent sales organizations and financial and other websites. Our business \\ndevelopment team is dedicated to expanding our network of strategic partners and leveraging their relationships with \\nsmall businesses to acquire new customers.  In general, if a strategic partner refers a customer that takes a loan from us, \\nwe pay that strategic partner a fee based on the amount of the originated loan.  Strategic partners differ from funding \\nadvisors (described below) in that strategic partners generally provide a referral to our direct sales team and our direct \\nsales team is the main point of contact with the customer.  On the other hand, funding advisors serve as the main points \\nof contact with the customer on its initial loan and may help a customer access multiple funding options besides those \\nwe offer.  As such, funding advisors\\' commissions generally exceed strategic partners\\' referral fees. We generally do not \\nrecover these commissions or fees upon default of a loan. Generally, no other fees are paid to strategic partners. \\n\\nThrough our Funding Advisor Program, we make contact with prospective customers by entering into relationships with \\nthird-party independent advisors, known as Funding Advisor Program partners, or FAPs, that typically offer a variety of \\nfinancial services to small businesses. FAPs conduct their own marketing activities, which may include direct mail, online \\nmarketing, paid leads, television and radio advertising or leveraging existing business relationships. FAPs include \\nindependent sales organizations, commercial loan brokers and equipment leasing firms. FAPs act as intermediaries \\nbetween potential customers and lenders by brokering business loans on behalf of potential customers. As part of our \\nFAP strategy, we require a detailed certification process, including background checks, to approve a FAP, and annual \\nrecertifications in order to remain a FAP. We also employ a senior compliance officer whose responsibilities include \\noverseeing compliance matters involving our Funding Advisor Program channel.  Our relationships with FAPs provide \\nfor the payment of a commission at the time the term loan is originated or line of credit account is opened. We generally \\ndo not recover these commissions upon default of a loan. As of December 31, 2017, we had active relationships with \\nmore than 400 FAPs, and in 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single FAP was associated with more than 2%, 2%, and 2% of our \\ntotal originations, respectively.\\n\\n• Extend Customer Lifetime Value. We believe we have an opportunity to increase revenue and loyalty from new and \\nexisting customers, thereby extending customer lifetime value. We seek to accomplish this by accommodating our \\ncustomers’ needs as they grow and as their funding needs increase and change. We continue to add benefits to our customer \\nofferings to increase engagement and usage of our platform.  For example, in 2016, we introduced new online features \\nincluding downloadable monthly statements and payment transaction reports, and new digital content, and in 2017 we \\ncontinued to explore opportunities to incorporate flexibility into our funding features.\\n\\n• Funnel Optimization. During 2017, we strategically tightened our credit policy in light of higher than expected loss rates \\nwithin several areas of our 2016 and older loan cohorts.  We believe we have now identified several opportunities to \\nfurther refine our decisioning model which will allow us to responsibly grant credit to certain portions of populations \\nthat underperformed historically. In addition, we will issue more conservative loan offers to populations that in the past \\nmight have received higher loan amounts or longer terms, reducing risk in those populations through lower payment \\nstress and duration risk.\\n\\n• OnDeck-as-a-Service. We believe that an opportunity exists to leverage the decisioning strength of our platform and the \\nOnDeck Score, as evidenced by our partnership with JPM, which uses our platform to make loan decisions for their own \\ncustomers. We are actively seeking to expand the availability of OnDeck-as-a-Service to other appropriate partners, and \\nexpect to announce another major bank partner in 2018.\\n\\n• International Growth. We plan to grow our business, while closely monitoring and adjusting our pricing and acquisition \\ncosts, in both Canada and Australia, where we believe the markets for online small business loans are still relatively new \\nand underserved. Although we believe there are other promising international markets, our near term plans do not include \\nexpansion into additional countries. \\n\\nOur Loans and Loan Pricing\\n\\nWe offer term loans and lines of credit to eligible small businesses. We currently offer term loans from $5,000 to $500,000. \\nThe principal amount of our term loan is a function of our credit risk and cash flow assessments of the customer’s ability to repay \\nthe loan. The original term of each individual term loan ranges from 3 to 36 months. Customers repay our term loans through \\nfixed, automatic ACH collections from their business bank account on either a daily or weekly basis. Certain term loans are \\noriginated by our issuing bank partner and loans that we purchase from our issuing bank partner have similar performance and \\ncharacteristics to loans that we originate. We offer a revolving line of credit with fixed six month level-yield amortization on \\namounts outstanding and automated weekly payments. We currently offer lines of credit from $6,000 to $100,000. A customer \\nmay be offered a line of credit based on our credit risk assessment of the customer’s ability to repay the line of credit. During the \\nfirst quarter of 2016, we began to purchase lines of credit from our issuing bank partner.\\n\\nOur loans are priced based on a risk assessment generated by our proprietary data and analytics engine, which includes the \\nOnDeck Score. Customer pricing is determined primarily based on the customer’s OnDeck Score, the loan term and origination \\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nchannel. Loans originated through direct marketing and strategic partners are generally priced lower than loans originated through \\nFAPs due to the commission structure of the FAP program. Additionally, we may offer discounts to qualified repeat customers as \\npart of our loyalty program.\\n\\nFor all of our term loans and lines of credit, our customers are quoted multiple pricing metrics to provide transparency and \\nhelp them better understand the cost of their loan, including:\\n\\n• the total payback cost in dollars;\\n\\n• the annual percentage rate, or APR;\\n\\n• the average monthly payment amount; and \\n\\n• the “Cents on Dollar,” or COD, which expresses the total amount of interest that will be paid per dollar    \\nborrowed. \\n\\nWhile APR is provided to all of our customers for comparison purposes, we do not use APR to determine the interest we \\nwill charge a customer on a particular loan. We believe APR is most useful when comparing longer-term loans (12 months or \\nmore) of similar expected duration and is less useful when comparing shorter-term loans (12 months or less).  Given the use case \\nand payback period associated with our loans, we believe our customers understand pricing on a “dollars in, dollars out” basis \\nand are primarily focused on total payback cost. For example, as of December 31, 2017, our customers pay between $0.003 and \\n$0.04 per month in interest for every dollar they borrow under one of our term loans. \\n\\nWe believe that our product pricing has historically fallen between traditional bank loans to small businesses and certain \\nnon-bank small business financing alternatives such as merchant cash advances.  From 2013 to 2016, the weighted average APR \\nfor term loans and lines of credit declined from 63.4% in 2013 to 41.4% in 2016.  During the same period, the weighted average \\nCOD per dollar borrowed per month for term loans declined from 2.65 cents in 2013 to 1.82 cents in 2016. During the second \\nhalf of 2016 and throughout 2017, we implemented price increases which began to increase our weighted average COD and \\nweighted average APR.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, our weighted average COD per dollar borrowed per month and \\nweighted average APR were 1.95 cents and 43.7%, respectively.  We intend to continue to manage the pricing of our loans to \\noptimize between risk-adjusted yields and loan origination volume.  See Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \\nCondition and Results of Operations —Key Factors Affecting Our Performance—Pricing.\\n\\nIn order to provide our customers with additional information, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted the SMART \\nBox™ - which stands for “Straightforward Metrics Around Rate and Total cost,” a model pricing disclosure and comparison tool \\nintroduced by the Innovative Lending Platform Association, or ILPA, of which we are a founding member. The SMART Box \\npresents prospective customers with several standardized pricing metrics to evaluate the cost of the term loan or line of credit, \\nincluding the total cost of capital, APR, the average monthly payback amount, and the cents on dollar cost of the loan.\\n\\n Cents on Dollar borrowed reflects the monthly interest paid by a customer to us for a loan, and does not include the loan \\norigination fee and the repayment of the principal of the loan. The APRs of our term loans currently range from 5.9% to 99.7%\\nand the APRs of our lines of credit currently range from 11.0% to 60.8%. As noted above, because many of our loans are short \\nterm in nature and APR is calculated on an annualized basis, we believe that small business customers tend to evaluate these short \\nterm loans primarily on a Cents on Dollar borrowed basis rather than APR. \\n\\nOur Risk Management\\n\\nOur management team has operated the business through both strong and weak economic environments and has developed \\nsignificant risk management experience and protocols. \\n\\nWe make credit decisions based on real-time performance data about our small business customers. We believe that the data \\nand analytics powering the OnDeck Score can predict the creditworthiness of a small business better than models that rely solely \\non the personal credit score of the small business owner. Our analysis suggests that the current iteration of our proprietary credit-\\nscoring model has become more accurate than previous versions at identifying credit risk in small businesses across a range of \\ncredit risk profiles than personal credit scores alone.\\n\\nIn addition, because our loans generally require automated payback either each business day or weekly and allow for ongoing \\ndata collection, we obtain early-warning indicators that provide a higher degree of visibility not just on individual loans, but also \\non macro portfolio trends. Insights gleaned from such real-time performance data provide the opportunity for us to be agile and \\nadapt to changing conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the average length of a term loan at origination was \\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\napproximately 12.1 months compared to 13.2 months for the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe the rapid amortization \\nand recovery of amounts from the short duration of our portfolio helps to mitigate our overall loss exposure.\\n\\nOrganizationally, we have a risk management committee, comprised of certain members of our board of directors, which \\nmeets regularly to examine our credit risks and enterprise risks. We also have subcommittees of our risk management committee \\nthat are comprised of members of our management team that monitor our credit risks, enterprise risks and other risks.\\n\\nIn addition, we have teams of non-management employees within the company that monitor these and other risks. Our credit \\nrisk team is responsible for portfolio management, allowance for loan losses, or ALLL, credit model validation and underwriting \\nperformance. This team engages in numerous risk management activities, including reporting on performance trends, and \\nmonitoring of portfolio concentrations.\\n\\nOur enterprise risk team focuses on the following additional risks:\\n\\n• ensuring our IT systems, security protocols, change management process and business continuity plans are well \\nestablished, reviewed and tested;\\n\\n• establishing and testing internal controls with respect to financial reporting; \\n\\n• regularly reviewing the regulatory environment to ensure compliance with existing laws and anticipate future regulatory \\nchanges that may impact us; and\\n\\n• talent recruitment and retention.\\n\\nOur management team also closely monitors our competitive landscape in order to assess competitive threats. Finally, from \\na capital availability perspective, we employ a diverse and scalable funding strategy that allows us to access debt facilities, the \\nsecuritization markets and institutional capital through OnDeck Marketplace, reducing our dependence on any one source of \\ncapital.\\n\\nOur Subsidiaries\\n\\n We conduct certain of our operations through subsidiaries that support our business.  Seven of our subsidiaries are special \\npurpose vehicles acting as the borrower in different asset-backed revolving debt facilities and one other subsidiary is a special \\npurpose vehicle acting as the issuer under our current asset-backed securitization vehicle.\\n\\n See Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and \\nCapital Resources and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report for more information regarding \\nour subsidiaries.\\n\\nOur Information Technology and Security\\n\\nOur Information Security program is based principles that reflect our goals and that form the foundation of the policies, \\nstandards and procedures of our Information Security Policy. These underlying principles expand on traditional confidentiality, \\nintegrity and availability models to provide a framework for: safeguarding critical and sensitive company, customer and other \\ninformation we maintain in many formats including databases, electronic mail and paper documents; protecting critical company \\nbusiness applications, both those under development and those in live production environments; securing many types of computing \\ndevices including server farms and storage systems through desktop and laptop computers; protecting company communications \\nnetworks including wireless, voice over IP  and Internet connectivity; and facilitating discussions with third parties when \\nestablishing contracts or service level agreements governing information security arrangements.\\n\\nOur network is configured with multiple layers of security with the goal of detecting, preventing, and responding to \\nunauthorized access to or probing of our information.  In addition to regular internal vulnerability scans, we submit to external \\npenetration testing to validate our defenses and to identify areas for improvement.\\n\\nOur applications are engineered with a focus on security and protected using a number of preventative controls in addition \\nto in-code measures.  We also use security protocols for communication among applications.  All of our public APIs and websites \\nuse Transport Layer Security. Applications are analyzed for security flaws internally by a dedicated team in order to maintain our \\nsecurity posture through continued development and functional improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nOur systems infrastructure is deployed on a private cloud hosted in co-located redundant data centers in New Jersey and \\nColorado. We believe that we have enough physical capacity to support our operations for the foreseeable future. We have multiple \\nlayers of redundancy to support the reliability of network service and achieved 99.9% monthly uptime. We also have a working \\ndata redundancy model with comprehensive backups of our databases and software.\\n\\nOur Intellectual Property\\n\\nWe protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain names, copyrights and trade \\nsecrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology.\\n\\nWe have registered trademarks in the United States, Canada and Australia for “OnDeck,” “OnDeck Score,” “OnDeck \\nMarketplace,” the OnDeck logo and many other trademarks. We also have filed other trademark applications in the United States \\nand certain other jurisdictions and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it will be beneficial.\\n\\nOur Employees\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 475 full-time employees located throughout our New York, Denver, Virginia, Sydney, \\nAustralia, and Toronto, Canada offices as well as several remote employees.  In February and May 2017, we announced reductions \\nin our headcount as a result of announced layoffs and scheduled attrition, which together represented approximately 27% of our \\nyear end 2016 work force. We expect the number of full-time employees to increase in 2018 as we grow our business again and \\nexpand our offerings and features. \\n\\nWe are proud of our culture, which is anchored by four key values:\\n\\nIngenuity We create new solutions to old problems. We imagine what’s possible and seek out innovation and\\ntechnology to reinvent small business financing and delight our customers.\\n\\nPassion We think big and act boldly. We care intensely about each other, our company, and the small businesses we\\nserve.\\n\\nOpenness We are collaborative and accessible. We know that the best outcomes come when we work together.\\n\\nImpact We focus on results. We are committed to making every day count and constantly strive to improve our\\nbusiness. We work to make a difference to small businesses, their customers and our employees.\\n\\nWe consider our relationship with our employees to be good and we have not had any work stoppages. Additionally, none of our \\nemployees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\\n\\nGovernment Regulation\\n\\nWe are affected by laws and regulations, and judicial interpretations of those laws and regulations, that apply to businesses \\nin general, as well as to commercial lending. This includes a range of laws, regulations and standards that address information \\nsecurity, data protection, privacy, fair lending and anti-discrimination, transparency, licensing and interest rates, among other \\nthings. Because we are not a bank and are engaged in commercial lending, we are not subject to certain of the laws and rules that \\nonly apply to banks and consumer lenders.  However, we purchase term loans and lines of credit from our issuing bank partner \\nthat is subject to laws and rules applicable to banks and commercial lenders.  We may explore, among other regulatory alternatives, \\nthe U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s declared interest in offering a special purpose national bank charter for FinTech \\ncompanies.  Additionally, we are actively engaged in promoting industry standards and best practices as exemplified by our launch \\nand adoption of the SMART Box.  The SMART Box includes clear and consistent pricing metrics, metric calculations, and metric \\nexplanations to help small businesses understand and assess the costs of their small business finance options.  The SMART Box \\nmodel disclosure was made available for adoption by other capital providers through the ILPA.  We have also adopted the ILPA’s \\nCode of Ethics, which sets forth best practices for providing, facilitating and supporting the provision of capital to small businesses.\\n\\nState Lending Regulations\\n\\nInterest Rate Regulations\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nAlthough the federal government does not regulate the maximum interest rates that may be charged on commercial loan \\ntransactions, some states have enacted commercial rate laws specifying the maximum legal interest rate at which commercial \\nloans can be made in their state. We only originate commercial loans. All loans originated directly by us provide that they are to \\nbe governed by Virginia law.  Virginia does not have rate limitations on commercial loans of $5,000 or more or licensing requirements \\nfor commercial lenders making such loans.  Our underwriting, servicing, operations and collections teams are headquartered in \\nArlington, Virginia, and that is where our commercial loan contracts are made. With respect to loans where we work with a partner \\nor issuing bank, the issuing bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank in connection with its commercial \\nloans.\\n\\nLicensing Requirements\\n\\nIn states and jurisdictions that do not require a license to make commercial loans, we make term loans and extend lines of \\ncredit directly to customers pursuant to Virginia law, which is the governing law we require in the underlying loan agreements \\nwith our customers. There are four states that have licensing requirements where we do not make any term loans and instead \\npurchase term loans made by an issuing bank partner: California, Nevada, North Dakota and South Dakota. Beginning in 2016, \\nwe began to acquire line of credit draws under lines of credit extended by our issuing bank partner in those four states and Vermont.   \\nDue to regulatory limitations, we do not originate lines of credit directly in those five states.  In addition to those five states, there \\nare other states and jurisdictions that require a license or have other requirements to make certain commercial loans, including \\nboth term loans and lines of credit, and may not honor a Virginia choice of law. In these other states, historically we have originated \\nsome term loans and lines of credit directly but purchased other term loans and lines of credit from issuing bank partners, the \\nforegoing depending on the requirements of these other states.  Those other states assert either that their own licensing laws and \\nrequirements should generally apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks, or apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks of \\ncertain principal amounts, with certain interest rates, to certain business entity types or based on other terms. In such other states \\nand jurisdictions and in some other circumstances, term loans and lines of credit are made by an issuing bank partner that is not \\nsubject to state licensing, and may be sold to us. Certain lines of credit are extended by an issuing bank partner in all 50 states in \\nthe U.S. and we may purchase extensions under those lines of credit.  For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, \\nloans made by issuing bank partners constituted 22.6%, 22.2% and 15.3%, respectively, of our total loan originations (including \\nboth term loans and draws on lines of credit). \\n\\nThe issuing bank partner establishes its underwriting criteria for the issuing bank partner program in consultation with us. \\nWe recommend commercial loans to the issuing bank partner that meet the bank partner\\'s underwriting criteria, at which point the \\nissuing bank partner may elect to fund the term loan or extend the line of credit. If the issuing bank partner decides to fund the \\nloan (including term loans and line of credit extensions), it retains the economics on the loan for the period that it owns the loan. \\nThe issuing bank partner earns origination fees from the customers who borrow from it and in addition retains the interest paid \\nduring the period that the issuing bank partner owns the loan. In exchange for recommending loans to an issuing bank partner, we \\nearn a marketing referral fee based on the loans recommended to, and originated by, that issuing bank partner. Historically, we \\nhave been the purchaser of the loans that we refer to issuing bank partners.  Our agreement with our issuing bank partner also \\nprovides for a collateral account, which is maintained at the issuing bank. The account serves as cash collateral for the performance \\nof our obligations under the agreements, which among other things may include compliance with certain covenants, and also \\nserves to indemnify the issuing bank partner for breaches by us of representations and warranties where it suffers damages as a \\nresult of the loans that we refer to it.  The initial term of our agreement with our issuing bank partner, Celtic Bank, or Celtic, \\nexpires October 2018 and the agreement automatically extends for one-year periods unless terminated by either party.  Celtic is \\nan industrial bank chartered by the state of Utah and makes small business and certain other loans. The agreement with Celtic may \\nnot be assigned without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party. We may in the future and from time to time work \\nwith a different bank partner, or multiple bank partners.   \\n\\nWe are not required to have licenses to make commercial loans under state law as currently in effect and our operations as \\npresently conducted. Virginia, unlike some other jurisdictions, does not require licensing of commercial lenders. Because we make \\nloans from Virginia in accordance with the Virginia choice of law in our loan agreements, we are not required to be licensed as a \\nlender in other jurisdictions that honor the Virginia choice of law. \\n\\nFederal Lending Regulations\\n\\n We are a commercial lender and as such there are federal laws and regulations that affect our and other lenders’ lending \\noperations. These laws include, among others, portions of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or the Dodd-Frank \\nAct, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Economic and Trade Sanctions rules, the Electronic Signatures \\nin Global and National Commerce Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, \\nand Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts or practices.  In addition, there are other federal laws that do \\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nnot directly govern our business but with respect to which we have established certain procedures, including procedures to designed \\nto protect our platform from being used to launder money.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nThe small business lending market is highly competitive and fragmented and we expect it to remain so in the future. Our \\nprincipal competitors include traditional banks, legacy merchant cash advance providers, and newer, technology-enabled lenders.  \\nWe believe the principal factors that generally determine a company’s competitive advantage in our market include the following:\\n \\n\\n• ease of process to apply for a loan;\\n\\n• brand recognition and trust;\\n\\n• loan features, including amount, rate, term and pay-back method;\\n\\n• loan product fit for business purpose;\\n\\n• transparent description of key terms;\\n\\n• effectiveness of underwriting;\\n\\n• effectiveness of operational processes;\\n\\n• effectiveness of customer acquisition; and\\n\\n• customer experience.\\n\\n See Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors \\nAffecting Our Performance - Competition.\\n\\nDisclosure of Information\\n\\nWe recognize that in today’s environment, our current and potential investors, the media and others interested in us look to \\nsocial media and other online sources for information about us.

The website of the SEC site is www.sec.gov. \\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nIndustry and Market Data\\n\\nThis report contains estimates, statistical data, and other information concerning our industry that are based on industry \\npublications, surveys and forecasts. The industry and market information included in this report involves a number of assumptions \\nand limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such information.\\n\\nThe sources of industry and market data contained in this report are listed below:\\n \\n\\n• FDIC, Loans to Small Businesses and Farms, FDIC-Insured Institutions 1995-2017, Q2 2017.\\n\\nThe industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including \\nthose described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. These and other factors could cause our actual results to \\ndiffer materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\n\\nOur current and prospective investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in \\nthis report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of \\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” before \\nmaking investment decisions regarding our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face, \\nbut include the most significant factors currently known by us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that \\nwe currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks materialize, \\nour business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of our \\nsecurities could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\\n\\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve consistent profitability in the future.\\n\\nWe generated net losses of $14.3 million, $85.5 million and $2.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of \\nDecember 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $222.8 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue \\nlevels in future periods in order to become profitable in the future, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase \\nour level of profitability.  We intend to continue to expend significant funds on our marketing and sales operations, increasing our \\ninvestment in technology and analytics capabilities, increasing our customer service and general loan servicing capabilities, meeting \\nthe increased compliance requirements associated with our operation as a public company and changing regulatory requirements, \\nand upgrading our technology infrastructure and expanding in existing or possibly new markets.  In addition, we record our loan \\nloss provision as an expense to account for the possibility that loans we intend to hold (rather than sell) may not be repaid in full. \\nBecause we incur a given loan loss expense at the time that we issue the loans we intend to hold, we expect the aggregate amount \\nof this expense to grow as we increase the total amount of loans we make to our customers.\\n\\nOur efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough \\nto offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other \\nrisks described in this report, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events. If we \\nare unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease.\\n\\nWorsening economic conditions may result in decreased demand for our loans, cause our customers’ default rates to increase \\nand harm our operating results.\\n\\nUncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant \\ntightening of credit markets, historically have created a difficult environment for companies in the lending industry. Many factors, \\nincluding factors that are beyond our control, may have a detrimental impact on our operating performance. These factors include \\ngeneral economic conditions, unemployment levels, energy costs and interest rates, as well as events such as natural disasters, \\nacts of war, terrorism and catastrophes.\\n\\nOur customers are small businesses. Accordingly, our customers historically have been, and may in the future remain, more \\nlikely to be affected or more severely affected than large enterprises by adverse economic conditions. These conditions may result \\nin a decline in the demand for our loans by potential customers, higher default rates, or both by our existing customers. If a customer \\ndefaults on a loan payable to us, the loan enters a collections process where our systems and collections teams initiate contact with \\nthe customer for payments owed. If a loan is subsequently charged off, historically we had generally sold the loan to a third-party \\ncollection agency in exchange for only a small fraction of the remaining amount payable to us. \\n\\nIn addition, we recently changed and expect to continue our collections strategy to retain more and sell fewer charged-off \\nloans, with the goal of achieving higher recoveries. There is no assurance that this strategy will be successful, and it could result \\nin lower recoveries than we have realized historically from selling charged-off loans. It may also lead to increased litigation, \\nnegative publicity and harm to our reputation.\\n\\nThere can be no assurance that economic conditions will remain favorable for our business or that demand for our loans or \\ndefault rates by our customers will remain at current levels. Reduced demand for our loans would negatively impact our growth \\nand revenue, while increased default rates by our customers may inhibit our access to capital, including debt warehouse facilities, \\nsecuritizations and OnDeck Marketplace, and negatively impact our profitability. Customer default rates and changes in the \\nfinancial markets, including changes in credit markets and interest rates, can also impact the price that investors are willing to pay \\nfor our loans through OnDeck Marketplace, if at all, which can adversely impact our gain on sale revenue and limit our financing \\nalternatives. Furthermore, we have received a large number of applications from potential customers who do not satisfy the \\nrequirements for an OnDeck loan. If an insufficient number of qualified small businesses apply for our loans, our growth and \\nrevenue could decline.\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nAn increase in customer default rates may reduce our overall profitability and could also affect our ability to attract institutional \\nfunding. Further, historical default rates may not be indicative of future results.\\n\\nCustomer default rates may be significantly affected by economic downturns or general economic conditions beyond our \\ncontrol and beyond the control of individual customers. In particular, loss rates on customer loans may increase due to factors \\nsuch as prevailing interest rates, the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer and business confidence, commercial real estate \\nvalues, the value of the U.S. dollar, energy prices, changes in consumer and business spending, the number of personal and business \\nbankruptcies, disruptions in the credit markets and other factors. We offer both our term loan and line of credit loans to the same \\ncustomers, subject to customary credit and loan underwriting procedures. To the extent that our customers borrow from us under \\nboth types of loans and default, our losses could be greater than if we had offered them only one type of loan. In addition, as of \\nDecember 31, 2017, approximately 27.9% of our total loans outstanding related to customers with fewer than five years of operating \\nhistory. While our OnDeck Score is designed to establish that, notwithstanding such limited operating and financial history, \\ncustomers would be a reasonable credit risk, our loans may nevertheless be expected to have a higher default rate than loans made \\nto customers with more established operating and financial histories. In addition, if default rates, delinquency rates or certain \\nperformance metrics reach certain levels, the principal of our securitized notes or other borrowings may be required to be paid \\ndown, and we may no longer be able to borrow from our debt facilities to fund future loans. In addition, if customer default rates \\nincrease beyond forecast levels, returns for investors in our OnDeck Marketplace program will decline and demand by investors \\nto participate in this program will decrease, each of which will harm our reputation and operating results.\\n\\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective.\\n\\nWe could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, \\nmanage, monitor and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risk, as \\nwell as operational risks related to our business, assets and liabilities. To the extent our models used to assess the creditworthiness \\nof potential customers do not adequately identify potential risks, the OnDeck Score produced would not adequately represent the \\nrisk profile of such customers and could result in higher risk than anticipated. Our risk management policies, procedures, and \\ntechniques, including our use of our proprietary OnDeck Score technology, may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are \\nexposed to, mitigate the risks that we have identified or identify concentrations of risk or additional risks to which we may become \\nsubject in the future. Furthermore, there may be a lag in the time in which a customer begins to show signs of an inability to pay \\nback a loan and when we begin to take remedial action in respect this loan, and as a consequence this could impair our eventual \\nability to receive repayment on the loan. \\n\\nWe rely on our proprietary credit models in the forecasting of loss rates. If we are unable to effectively forecast loss rates, it \\ncan materially adversely affect our operating results.   Our use of judgmental underwriting has similar risks.   \\n\\nIn making a decision whether to extend credit to prospective customers, we rely primarily on our OnDeck Score, the credit \\nscore generated by our proprietary credit-scoring model and decisioning system, an empirically derived suite of statistical models \\nbuilt using third-party data, data from our customers and our credit experience gained through monitoring the performance of our \\ncustomers over time. If our proprietary credit-scoring model and decisioning system fails to adequately predict the creditworthiness \\nof our customers, including because the factors used to determine the customer\\'s creditworthiness were not representative of such \\ncustomer\\'s true credit risk profile, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future need to record, additional provision expense \\nand/or experience higher than forecasted losses.  In addition, if our proprietary cash flow analytics system fails to assess prospective \\ncustomers’ financial ability to repay their loans, or if any portion of the information pertaining to the prospective customer is false, \\ninaccurate or incomplete, and our systems did not detect such falsities, inaccuracies or incompleteness, or any or all of the other \\ncomponents of our credit decision process fails, we may experience higher than forecasted losses. Furthermore, if we are unable \\nto access the third-party data used in our OnDeck Score, or our access to such data is limited, our ability to accurately evaluate \\npotential customers will be compromised, and we may be unable to effectively predict probable credit losses inherent in our loan \\nportfolio, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\\n\\nAdditionally, if we make errors in the development and validation of any of the models or tools we use to underwrite the \\nloans that we securitize or sell to investors, these investors may experience higher delinquencies and losses and we may be subject \\nto liability. Moreover, if future performance of our customers’ loans differs from past experience (driven by factors, including but \\nnot limited to, macroeconomic factors, policy actions by regulators, lending by other institutions and reliability of data used in the \\nunderwriting process), which experience has informed the development of the underwriting procedures employed by us, \\ndelinquency rates and losses to investors of our securitized debt from our customers’ loans could increase, thereby potentially \\nsubjecting us to liability. This inability to effectively forecast loss rates could also inhibit our ability to borrow from our debt \\nfacilities, which could further hinder our growth and harm our financial performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nOur allowance for loan losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors and may not be adequate to absorb \\nloan losses.\\n\\nWe face the risk on the loans that we hold that our customers will fail to repay their loans in full. We reserve for such losses \\nby establishing an allowance for loan losses, the increase of which results in a reduction of our earnings as we recognize a provision \\nexpense for loan losses. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan \\nlosses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the forecasts \\nand establishment of loan losses are also dependent on our subjective assessment based upon our experience and judgment. Actual \\nlosses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses stem from factors beyond our experience, and unlike traditional banks, we \\nare not subject to periodic review by bank regulatory agencies of our allowance for loan losses.  In addition, for our line of credit \\nproduct we estimate probable losses on unfunded loan commitments in a process similar to that used for the allowance for loan \\nlosses. \\n\\nAs a result, there can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses or accrual for probable losses on unfunded line of \\ncredit commitments will be comparable to that of traditional banks subject to regulatory oversight or sufficient to absorb losses \\nor prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nOur business may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets, our failure to comply with our debt agreements, \\nor the termination of our debt agreements, any of which could result in reduced access to credit and other financing.  Additionally, \\nOnDeck Marketplace has continued to decline as a part of our overall funding strategy and there is no assurance that OnDeck \\nMarketplace participants will continue to purchase our loans. \\n\\nHistorically, we have depended on debt facilities and other forms of debt in order to finance most of the loans we make \\nto our customers. However, we cannot guarantee that these financing sources will continue to be available beyond the current \\nmaturity date of each debt facility, on reasonable terms or at all. As the volume of loans that we make to customers on our platform \\nincreases, we may require the expansion of our borrowing capacity of our existing debt facilities and other debt arrangements or \\nthe addition of new sources of capital. The availability of these financing sources depends on many factors, some of which are \\noutside of our control. We may also experience the occurrence of events of default or breaches of financial performance or other \\ncovenants under our debt agreements, which could reduce or terminate our access to institutional funding.\\n\\n In addition, OnDeck Marketplace has substantially declined as a portion of our funding strategy. For each of the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2017 OnDeck Marketplace represented \\n9.1%, 2.3%, 1.3% and 3.9% of our term loan originations, respectively. In addition, the premiums we were paid in 2017 were \\nlower than those received in 2016. By selling fewer loans via OnDeck Marketplace and at lower premiums, we realized lower \\ngain on sale of loans and hold more of our term loan originations on our balance sheet, which requires us to self-fund or finance \\na larger amount of loans. As a result, we have used, and may continue to use, available cash on hand to fund originations. While \\nthe premiums on sales of loans via OnDeck Marketplace have decreased, we have continued selling a portion of our loans through \\nOnDeck Marketplace to maintain active relationships with institutional loan purchasers and to obtain additional funding.  However, \\nto the extent that institutional investors that purchase loans from us through OnDeck Marketplace rely on credit to finance those \\nloan purchases, disruptions in the credit market could further harm our ability to grow or maintain OnDeck Marketplace. We may \\ncontinue selling a portion of our loans via OnDeck Marketplace, however, there can be no assurance that these investors will \\ncontinue to purchase our loans via OnDeck Marketplace.\\n\\nWe also rely on securitization as part of our funding strategy and have executed two securitization transactions, one of \\nwhich, with $250 million of capacity, is currently outstanding under which cash flow can be used to purchase additional loans \\nthrough April 30, 2018. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully access the securitization markets again. In \\nthe event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking and financial system, we cannot be sure that we will be able \\nto maintain necessary levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments or \\nthe liquidation of certain assets. \\n\\n Furthermore, during 2018, several of our debt facilities are scheduled to mature, representing an aggregate of $313.2 \\nmillion of debt capacity, including $30 million in October 2018, $119.7 million in November 2018, $125 million in December \\n2018 and an aggregate of $38.5 million under other facilities at various dates throughout 2018.  We may not be able to extend or \\nrenew these maturing debt facilities. \\n\\n Accordingly, if we are unable to renew or otherwise replace these facilities or generally arrange new or alternative \\nmethods of financing, our ability to finance additional loans utilizing these financing sources will end. The interest rates and \\nother costs of new, renewed or amended facilities may also be higher than those currently in effect. If we are unable to renew or \\notherwise replace these facilities or generally arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may be \\n\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nforced to curtail our origination of loans or reduce operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, \\nfinancial condition, operating results and cash flow.\\n\\nIncreases in customer default rates could make us and our loans less attractive to lenders under debt facilities and investors \\nin securitizations and institutional purchasers in OnDeck Marketplace which may adversely affect our access to financing \\nand our business.\\n\\n            We principally rely on credit facilities, securitizations and OnDeck Marketplace to fund our loans.  Increases in \\ncustomer default rates could make us and our loans less attractive to our existing (or prospective) funding sources.  If our \\nexisting funding sources do not achieve their desired financial returns or if they suffer losses, they (or prospective funding \\nsources) may increase the cost of providing future financing or refuse to provide future financing on terms acceptable to us or at \\nall.\\n              \\n            Our debt facilities for our funding debt and our securitization are non-recourse to On Deck Capital, Inc. and are \\ncollateralized by our loans.  If the loans securing such debt facilities and securitization fail to perform as expected, the \\nlenders under our credit facilities and investors in our securitization, or future lenders or investors in similar arrangements, may \\nincrease the cost of providing financing or refuse to provide financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\\n\\n           If we were to be unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may have to curtail or \\ncease our origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results \\nand cash flow. \\n\\nPurchasers of loans in OnDeck Marketplace bear the risks of loan ownership. Unsatisfactory performance of our loans may \\nreduce investor confidence and reduce the willingness of investors to participate in OnDeck Marketplace, which could harm our \\nability to grow or maintain OnDeck Marketplace. In addition, the gain on sale of loans through OnDeck Marketplace has declined \\nfrom $14.4 million, or 5.0% of gross revenue in 2016 to $2.5 million, or 0.7% of our gross revenue in 2017 reflecting a lower \\npercentage of our terms loans sold into OnDeck Marketplace. Because we decided to hold more loans on our balance sheet and \\nsell fewer loans through OnDeck Marketplace, our provision expense and interest expense have increased, reducing our operating \\nresults.\\n\\nOur recent growth may not be indicative of our future growth and, if we continue to grow, we may not be able to manage our \\ngrowth effectively.\\n\\nOur gross revenue grew to $351.0 million in 2017 from $291.3 million in 2016 and from $254.8 million in 2015. We expect \\nthat, in the future, even if our revenue continues to increase, our rate of revenue growth may decline.\\n\\nIn addition, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\\n \\n\\n• marketing, including expenses relating to increased direct marketing efforts;\\n\\n• expanding product offerings;\\n\\n• product development, including the continued development of our platform and OnDeck Score;\\n\\n• technology and analytics, including OnDeck-as-a-Service;\\n\\n• diversification of funding sources;\\n\\n• broadening distribution capabilities through strategic partnerships and funding advisors; \\n\\n• general administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance expenses related to being a public company; \\nand\\n\\n• expansion in Canada and Australia, and possibly into new international geographies.\\n\\nIn addition, our historical growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our \\noperational and financial resources. Finally, as our business grows, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial \\nand management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our \\nfinancial results will suffer.\\n\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may \\nincrease the risk that we will not be successful.\\n\\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected. Assessing our business and \\nfuture prospects is challenging in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability \\nto:\\n \\n\\n• increase the number and total volume of term loans and lines of credit we extend to our customers;\\n\\n• improve the terms on which we lend to our customers as our business becomes more efficient;\\n\\n• increase the effectiveness of our direct marketing, as well as our strategic partner and Funding Advisor Program customer \\nacquisition channels;\\n\\n• maintain or increase repeat borrowing by existing customers;\\n\\n• successfully develop and deploy new types of loans and new loan features;\\n\\n• successfully expand OnDeck-as-a-Service to additional lenders;\\n\\n• successfully maintain our diversified funding strategy, including through debt warehouse facilities, possible future \\nsecuritization transactions and OnDeck Marketplace;\\n\\n• favorably compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the business of lending to small \\nbusinesses including traditional lenders;\\n\\n• successfully navigate economic conditions and fluctuations in the credit market;\\n\\n• effectively manage the growth of our business;\\n\\n• obtain debt or equity capital on attractive terms;\\n\\n• successfully expand internationally; and\\n\\n• anticipate and react to changes to an evolving regulatory environment.\\n\\nWe may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could harm our business and cause our operating \\nresults to suffer.\\n\\nCompetition for our employees is intense. As expected, our 2017 reduction in force negatively impacted our hiring and \\nretention of employees. Failure to attract and retain qualified employees can have a material adverse effect on our business.\\n\\nCompetition for our employees, including and especially highly skilled engineering, data analytics, risk management and \\nfinance personnel, is extremely intense reflecting a tight labor market, particularly in New York City. Many of the companies \\nwith which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more \\nattractive financial terms of employment. In addition, candidates making employment decisions often consider the value of any \\nequity they may receive in connection with their employment. Any significant volatility or performance issues in the price of \\nour stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled technical, financial, marketing and other personnel. \\nWe also invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to other companies that may \\nseek to recruit them.\\n\\nIn 2017, we implemented a cost rationalization program to realign our cost structure and improve our financial \\nperformance. As part of this program we had significant headcount reductions, due to both announced layoffs and scheduled \\nattrition. As a result of these actions, we have experienced increased levels of employee attrition which was not unexpected \\ngiven the size of the reduction in force. The overall competition for our employees and any continuing impact of our headcount \\nreductions may make it more difficult and/or expensive to recruit and retain talent and train new employees. Failure to attract \\nand retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business including our ability to execute our growth \\nplans.\\n\\nWe rely on our management team and need additional key personnel to grow our business, and the loss of key employees or \\ninability to hire key personnel could harm our business.\\n\\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, \\nincluding Noah Breslow, our Chief Executive Officer. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, \\nmotivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant \\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\ncosts to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely \\naffect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely \\nbasis, or at all. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment \\nrelationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We \\ncannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we \\ndo not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be \\nmaterially and adversely affected.\\n\\nSecurity breaches of customers’ confidential information that we store may harm our reputation and expose us to liability.\\n\\nWe store our customers’ bank information, credit information and other sensitive data. Any accidental or willful security \\nbreaches or other unauthorized access could cause the theft and criminal use of this data. Security breaches or unauthorized access \\nto confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive \\nlitigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or \\notherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access \\nto any of our customers’ data, our relationships with our customers will be severely damaged, and we could incur significant \\nliability.\\n\\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not \\nrecognized until they are launched against a target, we and our third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these \\ntechniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to \\nnotify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach \\nare costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the \\neffectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation and we \\ncould lose customers.\\n\\nThe collection, processing, use, storage, sharing and transmission of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of \\nfederal, state and international laws and regulations, as well as our failure to adhere to the privacy and data security \\npractices that we articulate to our customers.\\n\\n We collect, process, store, use, share and/or transmit a large volume of personally identifiable information and other sensitive \\ndata from current and prospective customers. There are federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and the collection, use, \\nstorage, protection, sharing and/or transmission of personally identifiable information and sensitive data. Any violations of these \\nlaws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, address legal claims, and sustain \\nmonetary penalties, reputational damage and/or other harms to our business.  \\n\\n Furthermore, our online privacy policy and website make certain statements regarding our privacy and data security practices \\nwith regard to information collected from our customers.  Failure to adhere to such practices may result in regulatory scrutiny and \\ninvestigation, complaints by affected customers, reputational damage and other harm to our business.   If either we, or the third \\nparty service providers with which we share customer data, are unable to address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply \\nwith applicable laws and regulations, it could result in additional costs and liability, damage our reputation, and harm our business.\\n\\nOur ability to collect payment on loans and maintain accurate accounts may be adversely affected by computer malware, social \\nengineering, phishing, physical or electronic break-ins, technical errors and similar disruptions.\\n\\nThe automated nature of our platform may make it an attractive target for hacking and potentially vulnerable to computer \\nviruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.  It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement \\neffective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, in which case there would be an increased risk of fraud \\nor identity theft, and we may experience losses on, or delays in the collection of amounts owed on, a fraudulently induced loan. \\nSecurity breaches could occur from outside our company, and also from the actions of persons inside our company who may have \\nauthorized or unauthorized access to our technology systems.  In addition, the software that we have developed to use in our daily \\noperations is highly complex and may contain undetected technical errors that could cause our computer systems to fail. Because \\neach loan that we make involves our proprietary automated underwriting process, any failure of our computer systems involving \\nour automated underwriting process and any technical or other errors contained in the software pertaining to our automated \\nunderwriting process could compromise our ability to accurately evaluate potential customers, which would negatively impact \\nour results of operations. Furthermore, any failure of our computer systems could cause an interruption in operations and result \\nin disruptions in, or reductions in the amount of, collections from the loans we make to our customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\nAdditionally, if a hacker were able to access our secure files, he or she might be able to gain access to the personal information \\nof our customers. If we are unable to prevent such activity, we may be subject to significant liability, negative publicity and a \\nmaterial loss of customers, all of which may negatively affect our business.\\n\\nOur business is subject to the risks of hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, power outages, \\ntelecommunications failures and similar events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism, cyberattack, \\nand other actions. Comparable risks may also impact the demand for our loans or our customers’ ability to repay their \\nloans.\\n\\n Events beyond our control may damage our ability to accept our customers’ applications, underwrite loans, maintain our \\nplatform or perform our servicing obligations. Such events include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods \\nand other natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications failures and similar events. Despite any precautions we may \\ntake, system interruptions and delays could occur if there is a natural disaster, if a third-party provider closes a facility we use \\nwithout adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or if there are other unanticipated problems at our leased facilities. As we \\nrely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-\\nquality customer service, such disruptions could harm our ability to run our business and cause lengthy delays which could \\nharm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently are not able to switch instantly to our backup \\ncenter in the event of failure of the main server site. This means that an outage at one facility could result in our system being \\nunavailable for a significant period of time. Man-made problems such as terrorism, cyberattack, and other criminal, tortious or \\nunintentional actions could also give rise to significant disruptions to our operations. Our business interruption insurance may \\nnot be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or \\nother disruptions. Comparable natural and man-made risks may reduce demand for our loans or cause our customers to suffer \\nsignificant losses and/or incur significant disruption in their respective operations, which may affect their ability to repay their \\nloans.  All of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nOur current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future.  Our gain on sale of loans in our OnDeck Marketplace \\nprogram has declined and may decline further in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread or gains on \\nsales of loans could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nWe earn a majority of our revenues from interest payments on the loans we make to our customers. Financial institutions \\nand other funding sources provide us with the capital to fund these term loans and lines of credit and charge us interest on the \\ncapital that we utilize. In the event that the spread between the interest rate at which we lend to our customers and the interest rate \\nat which we borrow from our lenders decreases, our financial results and operating performance will be harmed. The interest rates \\nwe charge to our customers and pay to our lenders could each be affected by a variety of factors, including access to capital based \\non our business performance, the volume of loans we make to our customers, competition and regulatory requirements. These \\ninterest rates may also be affected by a change over time in the mix of the types of loans we provide to our customers and sell to \\nour investors, the mix of new and renewal loans and a shift among our channels of customer acquisition. Interest rate changes may \\nadversely affect our business forecasts and expectations and are highly sensitive to many macroeconomic factors beyond our \\ncontrol, such as inflation, recession, the state of the credit markets, changes in market interest rates, global economic disruptions, \\nunemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. In addition, we generate gains on \\nsales of loans to institutional investors through our OnDeck Marketplace program. The prices we are able to charge for loans we \\nsell are based on a variety of factors, including the terms and credit risk associated with loans, the historical credit performance \\nof the loans we sell, investor demand and other factors. If these variables or others were to change, we might be required to reduce \\nour sales prices on loans, sell fewer loans or both, which could reduce our gains on sales of loans in the OnDeck Marketplace\\nprogram. Our gain on sale of loans declined from $14.4 million in 2016 to $2.5 million in 2017. Any material reduction in our \\ninterest rate spread or gains on sale of loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial \\ncondition.\\n\\nThe lending industry is highly regulated. Changes in regulations, including recent changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \\nof 2017, or in the way regulations are applied to our business could adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOver the last few years, federal and state regulatory and other policymaking entities have taken an increased interest in \\nmarketplace and online lending, including online small business lending.  For example, in July 2015, the U.S. Department of the \\nTreasury issued a public request for information regarding expanding access to credit through online marketplace lending.  Activity \\nin various states has also increased, including in the states of California and New York. In December 2015, the California Department \\nof Business Oversight announced an inquiry into the marketplace lending industry and requested information from fourteen \\nmarketplace and online lenders including OnDeck.  The New York Department of Financial Services is expected to conduct its \\nown survey of marketplace and online lending in the first half of 2018.  These initiatives were presented as information gathering \\nprojects to assist federal and state officials in better understanding, among other things, the methods, role and impact of online \\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nand marketplace lending on credit markets. These initiatives either have resulted, or are expected to result, in policy \\nrecommendations that could impact our business practices and operations if the recommendations drive new laws or regulations.  \\nFor example, if New York were to enact legislation requiring licensure by commercial lenders or imposing certain applicable rate \\ncaps or other provisions inconsistent with our current business practices and alternative solutions were not available, we could be \\nrequired to change our business practices and operations in a manner that adversely impacts our business in New York.  We, or \\nour issuing bank partner, originated approximately 7% of our 2017 total originations in New York.\\n\\n            We expect these and other types of legislative and regulatory activities to continue in the future as marketplace and online \\nlending grow and become the subject of greater public interest.  For example, with the prospect of easing regulatory burdens at \\nthe federal level under the current administration, some states have indicated their intention to take more aggressive regulatory \\naction. We cannot predict the outcome of these or other comparable future activities, when or whether they will lead to new laws, \\nregulations or other actions or what they might be. However, the impact and cost of any possible future changes to laws or regulations \\ncould be substantial and could also require us to change our business practices and operations in a manner that adversely impacts \\nour business including by increasing compliance costs or requiring us to limit or modify our lending to comply.\\n\\nChanges in laws or regulations, including recent changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (and any related Treasury \\nregulations, rules or interpretations, if and when issued), or the regulatory application or judicial interpretation of the laws and \\nregulations applicable to us could adversely affect our ability to operate in the manner in which we currently conduct business or \\nmake it more difficult or costly for us to originate or otherwise make additional loans, or for us to collect payments on loans by \\nsubjecting us to additional licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements or restrictions in the future or otherwise. For \\nexample, if our loans were determined for any reason not to be commercial loans or interest rate limitations were imposed on \\ncommercial loans, or if the validity of our relationship with an issuing bank partner were successfully challenged under a “true \\nlender” theory or by similar arguments as made in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC, we would be subject to many additional \\nrequirements, and our fees and interest arrangements could be challenged by regulators, attorneys general or our customers. A \\nmaterial failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in regulatory actions, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, \\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and our ability to originate and service loans \\nand perform our obligations to investors and other constituents.\\n\\nA proceeding relating to one or more allegations or findings of our violation of such laws could result in modifications in \\nour methods of doing business that could impair our ability to collect payments on our loans or to acquire additional loans or could \\nresult in the requirement that we pay damages and/or cancel the balance or other amounts owing under the loans associated with \\nsuch violation. We cannot assure that such claims will not be asserted against us in the future. To the extent it is determined that \\nthe loans we make to our customers were not originated in accordance with all applicable laws, we would be obligated to repurchase \\nfrom the entity holding the applicable loan any such loan that fails to comply with legal requirements. We may not have adequate \\nresources to make such repurchases.\\n\\nIf the choice of law provisions in our loan agreements are found to be unenforceable, we may be found to be in violation of \\nstate interest rate limit laws.\\n\\nAlthough the federal government does not currently regulate the maximum interest rates that may be charged on commercial \\nloan transactions, many states have enacted interest rate limit laws specifying the maximum legal interest rate at which loans can \\nbe made in their state. We apply Virginia law to the underlying agreement for loans that we originate because our loans are \\nunderwritten and entered into in the state of Virginia, where our underwriting, risk, servicing, operations and collections teams \\nfunction.\\n\\nVirginia law does not limit interest rates on commercial loans of $5,000 or more. Assuming a court were to recognize this \\nchoice of law provision, Virginia law would be applied to a dispute between the customer and us regardless of where the customer \\nis located. We intend for Virginia law to control over any state interest rate limit laws that would otherwise be applicable to these \\nloans.  We are not aware of any broad-based legal challenges to date to the applicability of Virginia law to the loans we originate \\nor the loans of other companies. However, many laws to which we are subject were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and \\nrelated technologies and, as a result, do not expressly contemplate or address the unique issues of the applicability of state laws \\nto online transactions, including in our case, the origination of loans. In addition, many laws that do reference the internet are \\nbeing interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. As a result, we cannot predict whether a court \\nmay seek to apply a different state\\'s law to our loans or to otherwise invalidate the applicability of Virginia law to our loans. If the \\napplicability of Virginia law to these loans were challenged, and these loans were found to be governed by the laws of another \\nstate, and such other state has an interest rate limit law that prohibits the interest rate in effect with respect to such loans, the \\nobligations of our customers to pay all or a portion of the interest and principal on these loans could be found unenforceable. A \\njudgment that the choice of law provisions in our loan agreements is unenforceable also could result in costly and time-consuming \\nlitigation, penalties, damage to our reputation, trigger repurchase obligations, negatively impact the terms of our future loans and \\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nharm our operating results. Likewise, a judgment that the choice of law provision in other commercial loan agreements is \\nunenforceable could result in challenges to our choice of law provision and that could result in costly and time-consuming litigation.  \\nIn February 2017, in the Madden v. Midland case described in more detail immediately below, the U.S. District Court for the \\nSouthern District of New York held that applying the Delaware choice of law specified in the loan contract, which would have \\nresulted in the application of Delaware law that has no limit on allowable interest rates, would violate a fundamental public policy \\nof New York\\'s criminal usury statute.  The court then concluded that the New York usury law, and not Delaware law, applied to \\nthe loan.  That decision, or possible future decisions that similarly invalidate choice of law provisions in loan agreements, could \\ncause us to change the way we do business in particular states and to incur substantial additional expense to comply with the laws \\nof various states, including either licensing as a lender in the various states, altering the terms of our loans or requiring us to place \\nmore loans through our issuing bank partner.\\n\\nAs a result of court decisions in Madden v. Midland, in some circumstances, federal preemption and application of an out-of-\\nstate choice of law provision will not, or may not, be available for the benefit of certain purchasers or non-bank issuers of loans \\nto defend against a state law claim of usury.\\n\\nIn May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that federal law \\ndid not preempt a state’s interest rate limitations when applied to a non-bank debt buyer of a consumer credit card loan seeking \\nto collect interest at the rate originally contracted for by a national bank.  The Second Circuit did not decide, and remanded to the \\nU. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the question of whether New York law (the law of the state where the \\ndebtor lived) or Delaware law (the governing law stated in the loan agreement) governed the terms of the loan agreement.  Although \\nthe Second Circuit case was appealed, in June 2016 the United States Supreme Court declined to review the case, which had the \\neffect of leaving the decision of the Second Circuit intact. \\n\\nIn February 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on remand held that applying the Delaware \\nchoice of law specified in the loan contract, which would have resulted in the application of Delaware law that has no limit on \\nallowable interest rates, would violate a fundamental public policy of New York\\'s criminal usury statute.  The court then concluded \\nthat the New York usury law, and not Delaware law, applied to the consumer loan at issue in the case.\\n\\nThe Second Circuit’s holding in the Madden case is binding on federal courts in the states included in the Second Circuit - \\nNew York, Connecticut and Vermont.  Although the Madden case has received widespread criticism, in the event of an extension \\nof the Second Circuit\\'s decision, either within or outside the states in the Second Circuit, could challenge the federal preemption \\nof state laws setting interest rate limitations for loans made by issuing bank partners in those states.  Additionally if the decision \\nby the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York applying the law of the state of the borrower, and not the governing \\nlaw stated in the applicable loan agreement were applied by a state or federal court with proper jurisdiction to commercial loan \\ntransactions, either within or outside the State of New York, then those loans originated by OnDeck (or a portion of the principal \\nof and interest on such loans) might be unenforceable and penalties could apply depending on whether the terms of such loans \\nwere contrary to the law of the state of the borrower.  There could be other related liabilities and reputational harm if OnDeck or \\na subsequent transferee of the loan were to seek to collect on those amounts.  In addition, the U.S. District Court in the Madden \\ncase certified a class action to pursue other remedies against the defendants in that case.  It is possible that other out of state lenders \\nmaking loans to borrowers in New York, including us, may be subject to similar claims.\\n\\nThe U.S. District Court’s decision in the Madden case could limit the interest rates we can charge on our loans in New York \\nand possibly in the other states that have criminal usury caps if the principles in Madden were extended to the federal court districts \\nin those states, namely Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey Ohio and Pennsylvania, if the terms of \\nOnDeck loans were contrary to the laws in those states.  In those circumstances, we may need to change the interest rates and/or \\namount of loans we make in those states or otherwise change the way we do business in those states, we may be subject to litigation \\nand we may suffer an adverse impact on our business.\\n\\nIn February 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Protecting Consumers’ Access to Credit Act of 2017 \\n(H.R. 3299).  If enacted in its current form, this legislation would effectively overturn the Madden decision and codify the \\ncontractual doctrine of “valid when made” which, as applied to lending agreements, provides that a loan that is valid at \\ninception cannot become usurious upon subsequent sale or transfer to another person.  There can be no assurance that the \\nlegislation will be voted upon or passed by the U.S. Senate or signed into law by the President in its current form or at all.   \\n\\nIf our relationship with our issuing bank partner was to end or the legal structure supporting such relationship was to be \\nsuccessfully challenged, then we may have to comply with additional laws, regulations, and restrictions, and certain states may \\nrequire us to obtain a lending license.\\n\\nIn states that do not require a license to make commercial loans, we make term loans and extend lines of credit directly to \\ncustomers pursuant to Virginia law, which is the governing law we require in the underlying loan agreements with our customers. \\n\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nHowever, some states and jurisdictions, including Alaska, California, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, North \\nDakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia, require a license to make certain commercial loans and \\nmay not honor a Virginia choice of law. They assert either that their own licensing laws and requirements should generally apply \\nto commercial loans made by nonbanks to residents of their state or apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks to residents of \\ntheir state of certain principal amounts or with certain interest rates or other terms. In such states and jurisdictions and in some \\nother circumstances, term loans and lines of credit are made by our issuing bank partner that are not subject to state licensing and \\nmay be sold to us. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, loans made by our issuing bank partner constituted \\n22.6%, 22.2%, and 15.3%, respectively, of our total loan originations. These loans are not governed by Virginia law, but rather \\nthe laws of the issuing bank partner’s home state, which is Utah law in the case of our issuing bank partner, Celtic Bank. The \\nremainder of our term loans and lines of credit provide that they are to be governed by Virginia law. Our issuing bank partner \\ncurrently originates all of our loans in California, Nevada, North Dakota and South Dakota as well as some loans in other states \\nand jurisdictions in addition to those listed above. Although such states and jurisdictions may have licensing requirements and/or \\ninterest rate caps that purport to apply to some or all commercial loans, all such licensing requirements and/or caps that would \\notherwise be applicable are federally preempted when these loans are originated by our federally chartered or state chartered \\nissuing bank partners. Loans originated by our issuing bank partner are generally priced the same as loans originated by us under \\nVirginia law. While the other U.S. states where we originate loans currently honor our Virginia choice of law, future legal changes \\ncould result in any one or more of those states no longer honoring our Virginia choice of law. In that case, we could potentially \\naddress the legal change in a manner similar to how we approach the other states and jurisdictions that currently require licensing \\nand may not honor a Virginia choice of law, or we could consider other approaches, including licensing.\\n\\nIf we were otherwise not able to work with an issuing bank partner or if we were to seek to make loans directly in those \\nstates referenced above, we would have to attempt to comply with the laws of these states in other ways, including through obtaining \\nlending licenses. Compliance with the laws of such states could be costly, and if we are unable to obtain such licenses, our loan \\nvolume could substantially decrease and our revenues, growth and profitability would be harmed. In addition, if our activities \\nunder the current arrangement with our issuing bank partner were deemed to constitute lending within any such jurisdiction that \\nwould require a lending license, we could be found to have engaged in impermissible lending within such jurisdictions. As a result, \\nwe could be subjected to fines and other penalties, all or a portion of the principal and interest charged on the applicable loans \\ncould be found to be unenforceable and, to the extent it is determined that such loans were not originated in accordance with all \\napplicable laws, we could be obligated to repurchase any loans from our debt facilities and OnDeck Marketplace participants that \\nfailed to comply with such legal requirements. Any finding that we engaged in unlicensed lending in states for which a license \\nwas required could lead to litigation, fines and harm our reputation and negatively impact our operating results.  \\n\\nAs a result of becoming a public company in December 2014, we are obligated to maintain internal controls over financial \\nreporting and our management is required to report annually on the effectiveness of these internal controls. Any determination \\nthat these internal controls are not effective may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value \\nof our common stock.\\n\\nAs a public company, we are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our \\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 and as of subsequent year ends. This assessment needs to include \\ndisclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\nIn the past we have identified certain control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, including a significant \\ndeficiency. A control deficiency is considered a significant deficiency if it represents a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, \\nin internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by \\nthose responsible for oversight of a company’s financial reporting. In contrast, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination \\nof deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement \\nof the company\\'s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\\n\\nWe cannot assure you that we will not in the future have significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Because we are an \\n\"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm has not evaluated any of the \\nmeasures we have taken to address any deficiencies.\\n\\nBecause our business has grown and we are a public company, we are continuing in our efforts to transition to a more \\ndeveloped internal control environment that incorporates increased automation.  The actions we have taken and plan to take are \\nsubject to ongoing senior management review and audit committee oversight.\\n\\nWe also may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the \\nevaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that \\nwe are unable to remediate before the end of the same fiscal year in which the material weakness is identified or if we are otherwise \\nunable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are \\neffective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when applicable, if our auditors \\n\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nare unable to attest to management’s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the \\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\\n\\nWe will be required to disclose material changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, \\nour independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control \\nover financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, until the first audit \\nfollowing the date we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jump Our Business Startups Act of 2012, \\nor the JOBS Act, which will be no later than the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2019.   \\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing \\nnew internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff.\\n\\nWe require substantial capital and in the future may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and profitability \\nstrategy and, in particular, our ability to fund loan originations. If adequate capital is not available to us, our business, operating \\nresults and financial condition may be harmed. \\n\\nSince our founding, we have raised substantial equity and debt financing to support the growth of our business. Because we \\nintend to continue to make investments to support the growth of our business, we require additional capital to pursue our business \\nobjectives and growth strategy and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including lending \\nto our customers, increasing our marketing expenditures to attract new customers and improving our brand awareness, developing \\nand offering loans with new characteristics, introducing new loans or services, further expanding internationally in existing or \\nnew countries or further improving existing offerings and services, enhancing our operating infrastructure and potentially acquiring \\ncomplementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, on a regular basis we need, or we may need, to engage in equity or debt \\nfinancings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, in amounts we need, \\non terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Volatility in the credit markets in general or in the market for small business or internet \\nloans in particular may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. Furthermore, the cost of our borrowing \\nmay increase due to market volatility, changes in the risk premiums required by lenders or if traditional sources of debt capital are \\nunavailable. Volatility or depressed valuations or trading prices in the equity markets may similarly adversely affect our ability to \\nobtain equity financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing \\nstockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges \\nsuperior to those of holders of our common stock.\\n\\nIn particular, we may require additional access to capital to support our lending operations. In order to fund loans that cannot \\nbe financed through our debt facilities, we have used, and expect to continue to use, our available cash on hand.  Furthermore, for \\nall loans that are eligible for funding under the terms of our debt or securitization facilities, these facilities have advance rate \\nlimitations on the maximum percentage of collateral that may be financed, which requires us to fund the excess portion through \\nour available cash in hand. \\n\\nWe expect that we will continue to use our available cash to fund a portion of our loans and support our growth initiatives \\nand general operations. To supplement our cash resources, we may seek to expand or modify our existing debt facilities to provide \\nadditional capacity as well as expand loan eligibility; add new debt facilities or replace or renew debt facilities scheduled to expire; \\nenter into additional securitizations; increase the size of, or replace, our corporate debt facility; expand the volume of loans that \\nwe sell through OnDeck Marketplace and other potential options. If we are unable to adequately maintain our cash resources, we \\nmay delay non-essential capital expenditures; implement cost cutting procedures; delay or reduce future hiring; or reduce our rate \\nof future originations compared to current level. There can be no assurance that we can obtain sufficient sources of external capital \\nto support the growth of our business. Delays in doing so or failure to do so may require us to reduce loan originations or reduce \\nour operations, which would harm our ability to pursue our business objectives as well as harm our business, operating results and \\nfinancial condition.\\n\\nOur strategy to expand the availability of our platform to other lenders through OnDeck-as-a-Service relies on an unproven \\nbusiness model in an emerging industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate the prospects for that strategy and the risks and \\nchallenges we may encounter. \\n\\nPart of our growth strategy is to expand the availability of our platform to other lenders through OnDeck-as-a-Service.  This \\nstrategy relies on an unproven business model in an emerging industry.  As a result, the revenue and income potential of On-Deck-\\nas-a-Service and the related market opportunity are uncertain. In order to pursue this strategy we will be required to make significant \\ninvestments over time, attract new customers and retain existing ones. Future demand and market acceptance of OnDeck-as-a-\\nService are unpredictable. The sales cycle to attract a lender to our platform is long and complex, and once a lender is attracted, \\nthe integration and ramp up can also be long, complex and expensive.  As a result, it is difficult to evaluate the prospects for this \\nstrategy or the timing or degree of its potential success.  It is also difficult to assess the risks and challenges we may encounter in \\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\npursuing this strategy.  Many of these risks and challenges are in categories similar to those we face in our online small business \\nlending activities as described in this Item 1A. - Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.  Others may be in addition to, or greater \\nthan, those we face in our online small business lending activities. Additional or greater risks and challenges to expanding the \\navailability of our platform to other lenders may include: \\n\\n• lack of acceptance of On-Deck-as-a-Service by other lenders;\\n• reluctance of other lenders to share their customer data with us, or impacts of data and security breaches if they do;\\n• unwillingness of other lenders to use our platform because we are doing business with their competitors, or for \\n\\nother reasons;\\n• the possible preference of other lenders to build and use their own platforms, or platforms offered by existing or \\n\\nnew competitors of ours, for online small business lending;\\n• our ability to charge fees for services commensurate with the total cost of providing those services; \\n• the amount of time it may take us to integrate new lenders;\\n• our ability to fund investment to expand and customize our platform in advance of earning fee revenue related to \\n\\nthat investment;\\n• our ability to provide customized solutions that meet the needs of lenders;\\n• our ability to meet the performance criteria that customers or prospective customers require;\\n• the inability to retain one or more customers and the impact of that customer loss on other existing or prospective \\n\\ncustomers;  \\n• our ability to scale our platform to make it economically viable; and\\n• our ability to compete effectively with third parties seeking to provide similar services. \\n\\nWe may not be able to successfully address these risks and challenges, which could cause our strategy to fail, harm our \\nbusiness and cause our operating results to suffer.  In addition, OnDeck-as-a-Service, has placed, and if we are able to expand it \\nwill continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources.  If we cannot effectively \\nmanage the growth of this opportunity, our financial results will suffer.\\n\\nWe may evaluate, and potentially consummate, acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt \\nour business, and adversely affect our financial results.\\n\\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so \\nthrough the acquisition of complementary assets, businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The \\nidentification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully \\ncomplete identified acquisitions. We also have never made these types of acquisitions before and therefore lack experience in \\nintegrating such acquisitions, new technology and personnel. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\\n \\n\\n• diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\\n\\n• coordination of technology, product development and sales and marketing functions;\\n\\n• transition of the acquired company’s customers to our platform;\\n\\n• retention of employees from the acquired company;\\n\\n• cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\\n\\n• integration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative \\nsystems;\\n\\n• the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have \\nlacked effective controls, procedures and policies;\\n\\n• potential write-offs of loans or intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect \\nour operating results in a given period;\\n\\n• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, \\nviolations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\\n\\n• litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, \\ncustomers, former stockholders or other third parties.\\n\\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our future acquisitions and investments \\ncould cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities \\n\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nand harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence \\nof debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. \\nAlso, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize.\\n\\nWe face increasing competition and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\\n\\nWe compete with other companies that lend to small businesses. These companies include traditional banks, merchant cash \\nadvance providers and newer, technology-enabled lenders. In addition, other technology companies that primarily lend to individual \\nconsumers have been focusing, or may in the future focus, their efforts on lending to small businesses.  Competition has intensified \\nin small business lending and this trend may continue.\\n\\nIn some cases, our competitors focus their marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and other \\nfinancial relationships with specific industries such as restaurants. In other cases, some competitors may offer a broader range of \\nfinancial products to our clients, and some competitors may offer a specialized set of specific products or services. Many of these \\ncompetitors have significantly more resources and greater brand recognition than we do and may be able to attract customers more \\neffectively than we do.  In addition, as more and more competitors market to the same small businesses, it may be more difficult \\nand expensive for us to build our brand and achieve or maintain favorable customer response rates. \\n\\nWhen new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market \\nshare, they sometimes undercut the pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market \\nshare and/or ability to exploit new market opportunities. Our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these \\ncompetitive challenges. Further, to the extent that the commissions we pay to our strategic partners and funding advisors are not \\ncompetitive with those paid by our competitors, whether on new loans or renewals or both, these partners and advisors may choose \\nto direct their business elsewhere. Those competitive pressures could also result in us reducing the origination fees or interest we \\ncharge to our customers.  In addition, increased competition for customer response could require us to incur higher customer \\nacquisition costs and make it more difficult for us to grow our loan originations in both unit and volume for both new as well as \\nrepeat customers.  All of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future \\ngrowth.\\n\\nOur success and future growth depend in part on our successful marketing efforts and increased brand awareness. As part of \\nour cost rationalization program, we have reduced our investment in our brand. Failure to effectively use our brand to convert \\nsales may negatively affect our growth and our financial performance.\\n\\nWe believe that an important component of our growth will be continued market penetration through marketing directly to \\nsmall businesses. To achieve this growth, we anticipate relying on marketing and advertising while controlling customer \\nacquisition cost. As part of our 2017 cost rationalization program, we reduced our investment in brand advertising while \\nseeking to gain marketing efficiencies.  While our goal remains to increase the strength, recognition and trust in the OnDeck \\nbrand, drive more unique visitors to submit loan applications on our website, and ultimately increase the number of loans made \\nto our customers, our decision to reduce spending in this area and seek greater efficiencies could adversely affect our growth. \\nWe incurred expenses of $52.8 million and $67.0 million on sales and marketing in the years ended December 31, 2017 and \\n2016, respectively.\\n\\nOur business model relies on our ability to continue to scale and to decrease incremental customer acquisition costs as we \\ngrow. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in the number of loans we make, or if we maintain recent \\nlevels of brand investment or continue to reduce or discontinue our broad marketing campaigns, it could have a material adverse \\neffect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nTo the extent that Funding Advisor Program partners, other third parties or internal sales representatives mislead loan applicants \\nor engage or previously engaged in disreputable behavior, our reputation may be harmed and we may face liability.\\n\\nWe rely on third-party independent advisors, including commercial loan brokers, which we call Funding Advisor Program \\npartners, or FAPs, for a significant portion of the customers to whom we issue loans. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, loans issued to \\ncustomers whose applications were submitted to us via the FAP channel constituted 26.9%, 27.3% and 28% of our total loan \\noriginations, respectively. As a consequence of their status as independent contractors, we have less control of FAP sales activities \\nversus our internal sales representatives.  In early 2015, we took a number of steps to enhance our then existing efforts to mitigate \\nthe risks associated with FAP sales, as discussed below.\\n\\nBecause FAPs earn fees on a commission basis, FAPs may have an incentive to mislead loan applicants, facilitate the \\nsubmission by loan applicants of false application data or engage in other disreputable behavior so as to earn additional commissions. \\n\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\nIn addition, it is possible that some FAPs may attempt to charge additional fees despite our contractual prohibitions. We also rely \\non our direct sales agents for customer acquisition in our direct marketing channel, who may also be motivated to engage in \\ndisreputable behavior to increase our customer base. If FAPs or our direct sales agents mislead our customers or engage in any \\nother disreputable behavior, our customers are less likely to be satisfied with their experience and to become repeat customers, \\nand we may be subject to costly and time-consuming disputes, each of which could harm our reputation and operating performance. \\nNegative publicity relating to FAPs could impair our ability to continue to increase our revenue and our business could otherwise \\nbe materially and negatively impacted.\\n\\nIn early 2015, we significantly enhanced the nature and scope of the due diligence conducted on both prospective and existing \\nFAPs (we applied the enhanced due diligence retroactively to all FAPs with which we had arrangements as well).  We update such \\ndue diligence on all existing FAPs on an annual basis and continue to conduct enhanced due diligence on new prospective FAPs.  \\nWe also implemented certain enhanced contractual provisions and compliance-related measures related to our Funding Advisor \\nProgram, including FAP training, issuing a FAP code of conduct and conducting welcome calls or distributing welcome surveys \\nto customers (recently modified to customer surveys) who worked with FAPs to survey the FAPs’ practices (which, if in violation \\nof our code or contract, could lead to termination). While these measures were intended to improve certain aspects and reduce the \\nrisks of how we work with funding advisors and how they work with our customers, we cannot assure that these measures will \\nwork or continue to work as intended, that other compliance-related concerns will not emerge in the future, that the funding advisors \\nwill comply with these measures, and that these measures will not negatively impact our business from this channel, including \\nour financial performance, or have other unintended or negative impacts on our business beyond the FAP channel, such as with \\nexisting or potential strategic partners, customers or funding sources.\\n\\nIn addition, we do business with third parties who are not part of our Funding Advisor Program, including third parties \\nwho may refer potential customers to us or to whom we may refer potential customers for their businesses.  We are exposed to \\nthe risks of potential misleading or disreputable behavior from these third parties as well as from our FAPs. \\n\\nWe also face similar risks based on the behavior of our internal sales representatives.  We provide our internal sales \\nrepresentatives with sales scripts that have been reviewed by our compliance team.  Sales representatives receive rigorous training, \\nincluding in-person training conducted by our compliance team on avoiding unfair, abusive, and deceptive practices.  In addition, \\ninternal sales representative calls are recorded and monitored for purposes of compliance and quality assurance, and there is a \\nquality assurance team dedicated to these efforts, which efforts have continued to be refined and enhanced. Despite these measures, \\nwe cannot assure that that they will work as intended or that all of our internal sales representatives will comply with our procedures. \\nFailure of our internal sales representatives to do so would expose us to the same, or worse, consequences than those relating to \\nthe FAP channel because our direct sales channel is larger than our FAP channel and we have more direct control over our internal \\nsales representatives than we have over our FAP channel.\\n\\nWe pay commissions to our strategic partners, other third parties and FAPs upfront and generally do not recover them in the \\nevent the related loan or line of credit is eventually charged off.\\n\\nWe pay commissions to strategic partners and FAPs on the term loans and lines of credit we originate through these channels. \\nWe pay these commissions at the time the term loan is originated or line of credit is opened. However, we generally do not require \\nthat this commission be repaid to us in the event of a default on a term loan or line of credit. While we generally discontinue \\nworking with strategic partners and FAPs that refer customers to us that ultimately have unacceptably high levels of defaults, to \\nthe extent that our strategic partners and FAPs are not at risk of forfeiting their commissions in the event of defaults, they may, to \\nan extent, be indifferent to the riskiness of the potential customers that they refer to us.\\n\\nWe rely on data centers to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these data centers could interrupt or delay our \\nability to deliver our service to our customers.\\n\\nWe currently serve our customers from two third-party data center hosting facilities in New Jersey and Colorado, as well as \\n\"cloud\" data centers which delivers service over the internet. The continuous availability of our service depends on the operations \\nof these facilities and cloud services, on a variety of network service providers, on third-party vendors and on data center operations \\nstaff. In addition, we depend on the ability of our third-party facility and cloud service providers to protect the facilities against \\ndamage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. If there are \\nany lapses of service or damage to these facilities and cloud services, we could experience lengthy interruptions in our service as \\nwell as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. Even with current and planned disaster recovery \\narrangements, our business could be harmed.\\n\\nWe designed our system infrastructure and procure and own or lease the computer hardware used for our services. Design \\nand mechanical errors, failure to follow operations protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail, resulting in interruptions \\n\\n\\n\\n27\\n\\nin our platform. Any such interruptions or delays, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters or security \\nbreaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and cause our revenue to decrease and/or \\nour expenses to increase. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us \\nfor any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue and subject us to liability, which could \\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\\n\\nTo date, we have derived our revenue from a limited number of financing options and markets. Our efforts to expand our \\nmarket reach and financing options may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth.\\n\\nWe offer term loans and lines of credit to our customers in the United States and Canada and term loans to our customers \\nin Australia. Many of our competitors offer a more diverse set of financing options to small businesses and in additional international \\nmarkets. While we intend to eventually broaden the scope of financing options that we offer to our customers, there can be no \\nassurance that we will be successful in such efforts. Failure to broaden the scope of financing options we offer to potential customers \\nmay inhibit the growth of repeat business from our customers and harm our operating results. There also can be no guarantee that \\nwe will be successful with respect to our current efforts in Canada and Australia, as well as any further expansion beyond the \\nUnited States, Canada and Australia, if we decide to attempt such expansion at all, which may also inhibit the growth of our \\nbusiness.\\n\\nWe may not have adequate funding capacity in the event that an unforeseen number of customers to whom we have extended \\na line of credit decide to draw their lines at the same time.\\n\\nOur current capacity to fund our customers’ lines of credit through existing debt facilities is limited. Accordingly, we maintain \\ncash available to fund our customers’ lines of credit based on the amount that we foresee these customers drawing down. For \\nexample, if we make available a line of credit for $15,000 to a small business, we may only reserve a portion of this amount at \\nany given time for immediate draw down. We base the amount that we reserve on our analysis of aggregate portfolio demand and \\nthe historical activity of customers using these lines of credit. However, if we inaccurately predict the number of customers that \\ndraw down on their lines of credit at a certain time, or if these customers draw down in greater amounts than we forecast, we may \\nnot have enough funds available to lend to them. Failure to provide funds drawn down by our customers on their lines of credit \\nmay lead to negative customer experience, damage our reputation and inhibit our growth.\\n\\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting \\npublic companies, which could harm our results of operations and our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and \\nboard members.\\n\\nAs a public company we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company \\nand these expenses will increase after we cease to be an “emerging growth company.” In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and \\nrules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, impose various requirements on public \\ncompanies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to \\ndevote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations and future \\nregulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time \\nconsuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to \\nobtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur \\nsubstantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to \\nattract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers.\\n\\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control \\nover financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, we are \\nrequired to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management \\nto report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control \\nover financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. As long as we remain an “emerging \\ngrowth company” we may elect to avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public \\naccounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. However, we may \\nno longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we cease to be an “emerging growth company” and, when our independent \\nregistered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, the cost \\nof our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 will \\nrequire that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we \\nimplement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to \\ncomply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public \\n\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\naccounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, \\nthe market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory \\nauthorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\\n\\nFurthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer if deficiencies are found, and this could cause a decline in the \\nmarket price of our stock. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal control over financial reporting \\ncould have a material adverse effect on our stated operating results and harm our reputation. We expect to have in place accounting, \\ninternal audit and other management systems and resources that will allow us to maintain compliance with the requirements of \\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act at the end of any phase-in periods permitted by the NYSE, the SEC and the JOBS Act. If we are unable \\nto implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and \\ncould result in an adverse opinion on internal control from our independent registered public accounting firm.\\n\\nOur agreements with our lenders contain a number of early payment triggers and covenants. A breach of such triggers or \\ncovenants or other terms of such agreements could result in an early amortization, default, and/or acceleration of the related \\nfunding facilities which could materially impact our operations.\\n\\nPrimary funding sources available to support the maintenance and growth of our business include, among others, an asset-\\nbacked securitization facility, other asset-backed revolving debt facilities and corporate debt. Our liquidity would be materially \\nadversely affected by our inability to comply with various covenants and other specified requirements set forth in our agreements \\nwith our lenders which could result in the early amortization, default and/or acceleration of our existing facilities. Such covenants \\nand requirements include financial covenants, portfolio performance covenants and other events. For a description of these \\ncovenants, requirements and events, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \\nOperations—Liquidity and Capital Resources. \\n\\nDuring an early amortization period or occurrence of an event of default, principal collections from the loans in our asset-\\nbacked facilities would be applied to repay principal under such facilities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund \\npurchases of newly originated loans. During the occurrence of an event of default under any of our facilities, the applicable lenders \\ncould accelerate the related debt and such lenders’ commitments to extend further credit under the related facility would terminate. \\nOur asset-backed securitization trust would not be able to issue future series out of such securitization if an early amortization \\nevent occurred. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under such facilities, the applicable lenders could seek \\nremedies, including against the collateral pledged under such facilities. An acceleration of the debt under one facility could also \\nlead to a default under other facilities due to cross-acceleration provisions.\\n\\nAn early amortization event or event of default would negatively impact our liquidity, including our ability to originate new \\nloans, and require us to rely on alternative funding sources, which might increase our funding costs or which might not be available \\nwhen needed. If we were unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we might have to curtail \\nthe origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash \\nflow, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations under our facilities.\\n\\nWe act as servicer with respect to our facilities. If we default in our servicing obligations, an early amortization event or \\ndefault could occur with respect to the applicable facility and we could be replaced as servicer.\\n\\nIn connection with the sale of our loans to our subsidiaries and through OnDeck Marketplace, we make representations and \\nwarranties concerning the loans we sell. If those representations and warranties are not correct, we could be required to \\nrepurchase the loans. In addition, we may, from time to time, voluntarily purchase loans previously sold to third parties. Any \\nsignificant required repurchases and/or voluntary purchases could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate and fund \\nour business.\\n\\nIn our asset-backed securitization facility and our other asset-backed revolving debt facilities, we transfer loans to our \\nsubsidiaries and make numerous representations and warranties concerning the loans we transfer, including representations and \\nwarranties that the loans meet the eligibility respective requirements of such facilities. We also make representations and warranties \\nin connection with the loans we sell through OnDeck Marketplace. If the representations and warranties that the loans meet the \\neligibility requirements are incorrect, we may be required to repurchase the loans not satisfying the eligibility requirements. Failure \\nto repurchase any loans when required would constitute an event of default under the securitization and other asset-backed facilities \\nand may constitute a termination event under the applicable OnDeck Marketplace agreement. At the request of a loan purchaser, \\nwe may voluntarily decide to purchase loans sold to third parties. There is no assurance, however, that we would have adequate \\nresources to make such purchases or, if we did make the purchases, that such event might not have a material adverse effect on \\nour business. Between June 2016 and December 2017, we voluntarily purchased $20.5 million of loans for strategic business \\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\nreasons and we may, from time to time, do so again in the future to the extent that we have adequate resources available. The \\npurchase of loans in large quantities, both on a mandatory or voluntary basis, may have an adverse impact on our liquidity and \\nour ability to originate loans, especially if we are unable to refinance such loans and elect to rely on available cash to purchase \\nthem. \\n\\nIf the information provided by customers to us is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge a customer’s qualification to receive \\na loan and our operating results may be harmed.\\n\\nOur lending decisions are based partly on information provided to us by loan applicants. To the extent that these applicants \\nprovide information to us in a manner that we are unable to verify, the OnDeck Score may not accurately reflect the associated \\nrisk. In addition, data provided by third-party sources is a significant component of the OnDeck Score and this data may contain \\ninaccuracies. Inaccurate analysis of credit data that could result from false loan application information could harm our reputation, \\nbusiness and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, we use identity and fraud checks analyzing data provided by external databases to authenticate each customer’s \\nidentity. From time to time in the past, these checks have failed and there is a risk that these checks could also fail in the future, \\nand fraud may occur. We may not be able to recoup funds underlying loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, \\nomissions of fact or fraud, in which case our revenue, operating results and profitability will be harmed. Fraudulent activity or \\nsignificant increases in fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand \\nand reputation, and require us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.\\n\\nFinancial regulatory reform relating to asset-backed securities has not been fully implemented and there is uncertainty \\nregarding its continuation, both of which could have a significant impact on our ability to access the asset-backed market.\\n\\nWe rely upon asset-backed financing for a significant portion of our funds with which to carry on our business. Asset-backed \\nsecurities and the securitization markets were heavily affected by the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, and \\nhave also been a focus of increased regulation by the SEC. However, some of the regulations to be implemented under the Dodd-\\nFrank Act have not yet been finalized and other asset-backed regulations that have been adopted by the SEC have delayed effective \\ndates. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the implementation of rules requiring securitizers or originators to retain an \\neconomic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any asset that they securitize or originate. In October 2014, the SEC adopted \\nfinal rules in relation to such risk retention, but such rules did not become effective with respect to our transactions until late in \\n2016. In addition, the SEC previously proposed separate rules which would affect the disclosure requirements for registered as \\nwell as unregistered issuances of asset-backed securities. The SEC has recently adopted final rules which affect the disclosure \\nrequirements for registered issuances of asset-backed securities backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto \\nloans, auto leases and debt securities. However, final rules that would affect the disclosure requirements for registered issuances \\nof asset-backed securities backed by other types of collateral or for unregistered issuances of asset-backed securities have not been \\nadopted. Additionally, there is general uncertainty regarding what changes, if any, may be implemented with regards to the Dodd-\\nFrank Act.  Any new rules or changes to the Dodd-Frank Act (or the current rules thereunder), if implemented could adversely \\naffect our ability to access the asset-backed market or our cost of accessing that market.\\n\\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity could result in a decline in our customer growth and our business could suffer.\\n\\nOur reputation is very important to attracting new customers to our platform as well as securing repeat lending to existing \\ncustomers. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain a good relationship with our customers or avoid negative \\npublicity. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from our conduct of business, negative publicity, regulatory, supervisory \\nor enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and New York Stock Exchange listing \\nrequirements, security breaches or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business.\\n\\nMany of our strategic partnerships are nonexclusive and subject to termination options that, if terminated, could harm the \\ngrowth of our customer base and negatively affect our financial performance. Additionally, these partners are concentrated \\nand the departure of a significant partner could have a negative impact on our operating results.  Lastly, any termination of \\nagreements governing our provision of OnDeck-as-a-Service could have a negative impact on our ability to grow this part of \\nour business and negatively impact our operating results. \\n\\nWe rely on strategic partners for referrals of an increasing portion of our customers and our growth depends in part on the \\ngrowth of these referrals. Over the last five years, loans issued to customers referred to us by our strategic partners have grown to \\nbecome an increasingly significant percentage of our total loan originations.   \\n\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\nMany of our strategic partnerships do not contain exclusivity provisions that would prevent such partners from providing \\nleads to competing companies. In addition, the agreements governing these partnerships contain termination provisions that, if \\nexercised, would terminate our relationship with these partners. These agreements also contain no requirement that a partner refer \\nus any minimum number of leads. There can be no assurance that these partners will not terminate our relationship with them or \\ncontinue referring business to us in the future, and a termination of the relationship or reduction in leads referred to us would have \\na negative impact on our revenue and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, a small number of strategic partners refer to us a significant portion of the loans made within this channel. In \\n2017, 2016 and 2015, loans issued to customers referred to us by our top four strategic partners constituted 11.1%, 12.0% and \\n11.5% of our total loan originations, respectively. In the event that one or more of these significant strategic partners terminated \\nour relationship or reduced the number of leads provided to us, our business would be harmed.\\n\\nAdditionally, we have continued exploring ways to expand the availability of OnDeck-as-a-Service to appropriate partners \\nthat could use our platform to make loan decisions.  The agreements governing these services contain termination provisions that, \\nif exercised, would terminate our agreement with these partners.  A termination of any such agreements may affect our reputation \\nas we seek to expand OnDeck-as-a-Service and/or have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results. \\n\\nIf we are unable to sell charged-off loans to third-parties and/or the premiums paid by such third-parties for charged-off loans \\nwere to decline, our operating results may be negatively affected. \\n\\nIf a loan is charged-off, historically we had generally sold the loan to third-parties in exchange for only a small fraction of \\nthe remaining amount payable to us. The agreements governing such arrangements with third-parties may be subject to termination \\nand/or renegotiation.  Any such termination and/or renegotiation of agreements already in place could result in our inability to sell \\ncharged-off loans and/or result in lower recoveries than we have realized historically from selling charged-off loans which could \\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. \\n\\nExpanding our operations internationally could subject us to new challenges and risks.\\nWe currently operate in the United States, Canada and Australia and may seek to expand our business further internationally. \\n\\nAdditional international expansion, whether in our existing or new international markets, will require additional resources and \\ncontrols. Such expansion could subject our business to substantial risks including:\\n\\n• adjusting our proprietary loan platform, and the OnDeck Score, to account for the country-specific differences in \\ninformation available on potential small business borrowers;\\n\\n• conformity with applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\\n\\n• changes to the way we do business as compared with our current operations;\\n\\n• the need to support and integrate with local third-party service providers;\\n\\n• competition with service providers that have greater experience in the local markets than we do or that have pre-existing \\nrelationships with potential borrowers and investors in those markets;\\n\\n• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse culture, laws and customs, and the \\nincreased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with international operations;\\n\\n• difficulties in securing financing in international markets in local currencies;\\n\\n• compliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including banking, \\nsecurities, employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\\n\\n• compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws, such as  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and comparable laws in \\nCanada, Australia and other non-U.S. markets into which we might expand in the future;\\n\\n• difficulties in collecting payments in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\\n\\n• restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\\n\\n• compliance with potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and \\napplicable U.S. tax laws as they relate to international operations, the complexity and adverse consequences of such tax \\nlaws and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in such tax laws; and\\n\\n• regional economic and political conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\nAs a result of these risks, any potential future international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful.\\n\\nOur business depends on our ability to collect payment on and service the loans we make to our customers.\\n\\nWe rely on unaffiliated banks for the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, transaction process used to disburse the proceeds \\nof newly originated loans to our customers and to automatically collect scheduled payments on the loans. As we are not a bank, \\nwe do not have the ability to directly access the ACH payment network, and must therefore rely on an FDIC-insured depository \\ninstitution to process our transactions, including loan payments. If we cannot continue to obtain such services from our current \\ninstitutions or elsewhere, or if we cannot transition to another processor quickly, our ability to process payments will suffer. If we \\nfail to adequately collect amounts owing in respect of the loans, as a result of the loss of direct debiting or otherwise, then payments \\nto us may be delayed or reduced and our revenue and operating results will be harmed.\\n\\nDemand for our loans may decline if we do not continue to innovate or respond to evolving technological changes.\\n\\nWe operate in a nascent industry characterized by rapidly evolving technology and frequent product introductions. We rely \\non our proprietary technology to make our platform available to customers, determine the creditworthiness of loan applicants, and \\nservice the loans we make to customers. In addition, we may increasingly rely on technological innovation as we introduce new \\ntypes of loans, expand our current loans into new markets, and continue to streamline the lending process. The process of developing \\nnew technologies and products is complex, and if we are unable to successfully innovate and continue to deliver a superior customer \\nexperience, customers’ demand for our loans may decrease and our growth and operations may be harmed.\\n\\nIt may be difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\\n\\nOur ability to lend to our customers depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology, including our use of the OnDeck\\nScore. We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate our business \\nprocesses and know-how, and adversely affect our ability to compete with them. A third party may attempt to reverse engineer or \\notherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our consent. The pursuit of a claim against a third party for infringement \\nof our intellectual property could be costly, and there can be no guarantee that any such efforts would be successful.\\n\\nIn addition, our platform may infringe upon claims of third-party intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property \\nchallenges from such other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to \\navoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. The costs of defending any such claims or litigation could be significant and, \\nif we are unsuccessful, could result in a requirement that we pay significant damages or licensing fees, which would negatively \\nimpact our financial performance. Furthermore, our technology may become obsolete, and there is no guarantee that we will be \\nable to successfully develop, obtain or use new technologies to adapt our platform to compete with other lending platforms as they \\ndevelop. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology from intellectual property challenges, or if the platform becomes obsolete, \\nour ability to maintain our platform, make loans or perform our servicing obligations on the loans could be adversely affected.\\n\\nSome aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these \\nopen source licenses could negatively affect our business.\\n\\nWe incorporate open source software into our proprietary platform and into other processes supporting our business. Such \\nopen source software may include software covered by licenses like the GNU General Public License and the Apache License or \\nother open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk \\nthat such licenses could be construed in a manner that limits our use of the software, inhibits certain aspects of the platform and \\nnegatively affects our business operations.\\n\\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works \\nwe create based upon the type of open source software we use. If portions of our proprietary platform are determined to be subject \\nto an open source license, or if the license terms for the open source software that we incorporate change, we could be required \\nto publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our platform or change our business \\nactivities. In addition to risks related to license requirements, the use of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use \\nof third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the \\nsoftware. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could adversely affect our \\nbusiness.\\n\\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could harm our results of \\noperations.\\n\\n\\n\\n32\\n\\nWe had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $82.1 million as of December 31, 2017. These net \\noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2027.  As of December 31, 2017, after giving effect \\nto new corporate tax rates prescribed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, we have recorded a full valuation \\nallowance of $37.8 million against our net deferred tax asset.\\n\\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net \\noperating losses and other tax attributes in the event of an “ownership change” of a corporation. Events which may cause limitation \\nin the amount of the net operating losses and other tax attributes that are able to be utilized in any one year include, but are not \\nlimited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period, which has occurred as a result of historical \\nownership changes. Accordingly, our ability to use pre-change net operating loss and certain other attributes are limited as prescribed \\nunder Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Therefore, if we earn net taxable income in the future, our ability to reduce our federal \\nincome tax liability with our existing net operating losses is subject to limitation. Although we believe that our initial public offering \\ndid not result in another cumulative ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, we do not believe that any resulting \\nlimitation will further limit our ability to ultimately utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes in a material \\nway. Future offerings, as well as other future ownership changes that may be outside our control could potentially result in further \\nlimitations on our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax attributes. Accordingly, achieving profitability may not result in \\na full release of the valuation allowance.\\n\\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\\n\\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and the value of your investment could decline.\\n\\nStocks of emerging growth companies have experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock \\nmay fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock may be higher or lower than the price you pay, depending on \\nmany factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations \\ncould cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading \\nprice of our common stock include the following:\\n \\n\\n• announcements of new types of loans, services or technologies, relationships with strategic partners, acquisitions or other \\nevents by us or our competitors;\\n\\n• changes in economic conditions;\\n\\n• changes in prevailing interest rates;\\n\\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\\n\\n• significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in our \\nindustry;\\n\\n• fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\\n\\n• the impact of securities analysts’ reports or other publicity regarding our business or industry;\\n\\n• actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\\n\\n• quarterly fluctuations in demand for our loans;\\n\\n• whether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\\n\\n• actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\\n\\n• regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\\n\\n• major catastrophic events;\\n\\n• sales of large blocks of our stock; or\\n\\n• departures of key personnel.\\n\\nIn addition, if the market for financial or technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor \\nconfidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial \\ncondition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our \\nindustry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s \\nsecurities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. In August 2015, we became the subject \\nof two putative class actions, which were subsequently consolidated, alleging that the registration statement for our IPO contained \\n\\n\\n\\n33\\n\\nmaterially false and misleading statements regarding, or failed to disclose, specified information in violation of the Securities Act \\nof 1933, as amended.  In September 2016, the consolidated cases were dismissed following the filing by the lead plaintiff of a \\nnotice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to all the parties. \\n\\nIf our stock price continues to be volatile, we may become the target of additional securities litigation in the future. Securities \\nlitigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. This could have \\na material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\n\\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could reduce \\nthe price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\\n\\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could \\noccur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common \\nstock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. At December 31, 2017, we had 73,822,001 shares of common stock outstanding.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2017, certain holders of our common stock (including shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of warrants to \\npurchase common stock), or their permitted transferees, have registration rights under certain circumstances to require us to include \\ntheir shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. It is not possible for us to determine \\nthe total number of our shares that are currently subject to such registration rights because certain of our stockholders with \\nregistration rights transferred their shares to the Depository Trust Company in order to hold such shares anonymously in “street \\nname.”  As a result, the actual number of shares with registration rights could be much larger than we are able to determine based \\non available information. We have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our \\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan and 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\\n\\nWe may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection \\nwith a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing \\nstockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\\n\\nInsiders and large stockholders have or could have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the \\noutcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\\n\\nOur directors, executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock \\nand their affiliates, in the aggregate, own approximately 47% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based on the number \\nof shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to influence or \\ncontrol matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions \\nor other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you \\ndisagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing \\nor deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their \\ncommon stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\\n\\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation \\nand expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive \\na return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\\n\\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability \\nto attract and retain qualified board members.\\n\\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing standards of the New \\nYork Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will \\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase \\ndemand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS \\nAct. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business \\nand operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In \\norder to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to \\nmeet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be \\ndiverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we \\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\nhave already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the \\nfuture, which will increase our costs and expenses.\\n\\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating \\nuncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. \\nThese laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as \\na result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This \\ncould result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure \\nand governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment \\nmay result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-\\ngenerating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the \\nactivities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our \\nbusiness may be harmed.\\n\\nHowever, for so long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of \\ncertain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” \\nincluding not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley \\nAct, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions \\nfrom the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden \\nparachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging \\ngrowth company.”\\n\\nWe would cease to be an “emerging growth company” upon the earliest of: (i) the first fiscal year following the fifth \\nanniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the \\ndate on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or \\n(iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million \\nas of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.  Based on the foregoing criteria, December 31, 2019 is  latest possible date \\nthrough which we will continue to be an emerging growth company.\\n\\nWe also expect that these new rules, regulations and standards may make it more expensive for us as a public company to \\nobtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher \\ncosts to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers \\nand qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Corporate \\nGovernance and Nominating Committee, and Risk Management Committee.\\n\\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging \\ngrowth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\\n\\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and are taking advantage of certain exemptions from \\nvarious reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but \\nnot limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, \\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions \\nfrom the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden \\nparachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because \\nwe may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active \\ntrading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\\n\\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate \\nor unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\\n\\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry \\nanalysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover \\nus should downgrade our shares, change their opinion of our shares or provide more favorable relative recommendations about \\nour competitors, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or \\nfail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading \\nvolume to decline.\\n\\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\\n\\n\\n\\n35\\n\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could \\ndelay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors \\nthat are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes \\nin our management. These provisions include:\\n \\n\\n• a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change \\nthe membership of a majority of our board of directors;\\n\\n• the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those \\nshares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute \\nthe ownership of a hostile acquiror;\\n\\n• the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of \\ndirectors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies \\non our board of directors;\\n\\n• a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special \\nmeeting of our stockholders;\\n\\n• the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our \\npresident, our secretary or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to \\nforce consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\\n\\n• the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding \\nshares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate \\nof incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated \\nbylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\\n\\n• the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to \\ntake additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquiror to amend the bylaws to \\nfacilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\\n\\n• advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to \\npropose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from \\nconducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control \\nof us.\\n\\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Risk Factors sections of this report for a discussion of important factors \\nthat could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements \\ncontained in the following discussion and analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n40\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nWe are a leading platform for online small business lending. We are seeking to make it efficient and convenient for small \\nbusinesses to access capital. Enabled by our proprietary technology and analytics, we aggregate and analyze thousands of data \\npoints from dynamic, disparate data sources to assess the creditworthiness of small businesses rapidly and accurately. Small \\nbusinesses can apply for a term loan or line of credit on our website in minutes and, using our proprietary OnDeck Score®, we \\ncan make a funding decision immediately and, if approved, transfer funds as fast as the same day. Qualified customers may \\ncarry both a term loan and line of credit simultaneously which we believe provides additional repeat business opportunities, as \\nwell as increased value to our customers. We originated $2.1 billion of loans in 2017 and more than $8 billion of loans since we \\nmade our first loan in 2007.\\n\\nWe generate the majority of our revenue through interest income and fees earned on the loans we make to our customers. \\nOur term loans, which we offer in principal amounts ranging from $5,000 to $500,000 and with maturities of 3 to 36 months, \\nfeature fixed dollar repayments. Our lines of credit range from $6,000 to $100,000, and are generally repayable within six months \\nof the date of the most recent draw. We earn interest on the balance outstanding and lines of credit are subject to a monthly fee \\nunless the customer makes a qualifying minimum draw, in which case it is waived for the first six months.  The balance of our \\nother revenue primarily comes from our servicing and other fee income, most of which consists of marketing fees from our issuing \\nbank partner, fees generated by OnDeck-as-a-Service, and fees we receive for servicing loans owned by third parties.\\n\\nWe rely on a diversified set of funding sources for the capital we lend to our customers. Our primary source of this capital \\nhas historically been debt facilities with various financial institutions. We have also used proceeds from operating cash flow to \\nfund loans in the past and continue to finance a portion of our outstanding loans with these funds. As of December 31, 2017, we \\nhad $690.4 million of funding debt principal outstanding and $1.0 billion total borrowing capacity under such debt facilities. \\nDuring the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, we sold approximately $74.2 million, $378.5 million and $617.7 million, respectively, \\nof loans to OnDeck Marketplace purchasers.  Of the total principal outstanding as of December 31, 2017, including our loans held \\nfor investment, plus loans sold to OnDeck Marketplace purchasers which had a balance remaining as of December 31, 2017, 3%\\nwere funded via OnDeck Marketplace purchasers, 58% were funded via our debt facilities, 30% were financed via proceeds raised \\nfrom our securitization transaction and 9% were funded via our own equity. \\n\\nWe originate loans throughout the United States, Canada and Australia, although, to date, substantially all of our revenue \\nhas been generated in the United States. These loans are originated through our direct marketing, including direct mail, social \\nmedia and other online marketing channels. We also originate loans through our outbound sales team, referrals from our strategic \\npartners, including banks, payment processors and small business-focused service providers, and through funding advisors who \\nadvise small businesses on available funding options.\\n\\n Key Financial and Operating Metrics\\n\\nWe regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. \\nThese metrics aid us in developing and refining our growth strategies and making strategic decisions.  Beginning with the three \\nmonths ended March 31, 2016, we refined the calculation of Effective Interest Yield, or EIY, and certain related definitions to \\npresent EIY on a business day adjusted basis and to reflect the substantial growth and impact of OnDeck Marketplace in 2015. \\nWe also refined the calculation of Net Interest Margin, or NIM, and certain related definitions to present NIM on a calendar day \\nadjusted basis.  In addition, effective January 1, 2016, we adopted a new requirement in accordance with accounting principles \\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, regarding the presentation of debt issuance costs.  All revisions \\nhave been applied retrospectively. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n41\\n\\nAs of or for the Year Ended\\nDecember 31,\\n\\n2017 2016 2015\\n(dollars in thousands)\\n\\nOriginations $ 2,114,663 $ 2,403,796 $ 1,874,438\\nEffective Interest Yield 33.9% 33.3% 35.4%\\nNet Interest Margin* 29.7% 29.7% 29.7%\\nMarketplace Gain on Sale Rate 3.4% 3.8% 8.6%\\nCost of Funds Rate 6.3% 5.9% 5.5%\\nProvision Rate 7.5% 7.4% 5.8%\\nReserve Ratio 11.6% 11.2% 9.8%\\n15+ Day Delinquency Ratio 6.7% 6.6% 6.6%\\nNet Charge-off Rate 15.8% 12.0% 13.7%\\nPre-Provision Operating Income* 139,345 64,895 72,938\\nPre-Provision Operating Yield* 14.3% 8.3% 13.5%\\n\\n*Non-GAAP measure.  Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for an explanation and reconciliation to GAAP.\\n\\nOriginations\\n\\nOriginations represent the total principal amount of the term loans we made during the period, plus the total amount drawn \\non lines of credit during the period. Many of our repeat term loan customers renew their term loan before their existing term loan \\nis fully repaid. In accordance with industry practice, originations of such repeat term loans are presented as the full renewal loan \\nprincipal, rather than the net funded amount, which would be the renewal term loan’s principal net of the unpaid principal balance \\non the existing term loan. Loans referred to, and originated by, our issuing bank partner and later purchased by us are included as \\npart of our originations. \\n\\nEffective Interest Yield\\n\\nEffective Interest Yield is the rate of return we achieve on loans outstanding during a period. It is calculated as our business \\nday adjusted annualized interest income divided by average Loans.  Annualization is based on 252 business days per year, which \\nis typical weekdays per year less U.S. Federal Reserve Bank holidays. \\n\\nNet deferred origination costs in loans held for investment and loans held for sale consist of deferred origination fees and \\ncosts. Deferred origination fees include fees paid up front to us by customers when loans are originated and decrease the carrying \\nvalue of loans, thereby increasing the Effective Interest Yield earned. Deferred origination costs are limited to costs directly \\nattributable to originating loans such as commissions, vendor costs and personnel costs directly related to the time spent by the \\npersonnel performing activities related to loan origination and increase the carrying value of loans, thereby decreasing the Effective \\nInterest Yield earned.\\n\\nRecent pricing trends are discussed under the subheading “Key Factors Affecting Our Performance - Pricing.”\\n\\nNet Interest Margin\\n\\nNet Interest Margin, is calculated as annualized Net Interest Income divided by average Interest Earning Assets. Net Interest \\nIncome represents interest income less funding cost during the period. Interest income is net of fees on loans held for investment \\nand held for sale. Net deferred origination costs in loans held for investment and loans held for sale consist of deferred origination \\ncosts as offset by corresponding deferred origination fees. Deferred origination fees include fees paid up front to us by customers \\nwhen loans are funded. Deferred origination costs are limited to costs directly attributable to originating loans such as commissions, \\nvendor costs and personnel costs directly related to the time spent by the personnel performing activities related to loan origination. \\nFunding cost is the interest expense, fees, and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs we incur in connection with our lending \\nactivities across all of our debt facilities. Annualization is based on 365 days per year and is calendar day adjusted.\\n\\nMarketplace Gain on Sale Rate\\n\\nMarketplace Gain on Sale Rate equals our gain on sale revenue from loans sold through OnDeck Marketplace divided by \\nthe carrying value of loans sold, which includes both unpaid principal balance sold and the remaining carrying value of the net \\ndeferred origination costs. A portion of loans regularly sold through OnDeck Marketplace are or may be loans which were initially \\ndesignated as held for investment upon origination. The portion of such loans sold in a given period may vary materially depending \\nupon market conditions and other circumstances.Cost of Funds Rate\\n\\n\\n\\n42\\n\\nCost of Funds Rate is our funding cost, which is the interest expense, fees and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs \\nwe incur in connection with our lending activities across all of our funding debt facilities. For full years, it is calculated as our \\nfunding cost divided by average funding debt outstanding and for interim periods it is calculated as our annualized funding cost \\nfor the period divided by average funding debt outstanding. Annualization is based on four quarters per year and is not business \\nor calendar day adjusted.\\n\\nProvision Rate\\n\\nProvision Rate equals the provision for loan losses divided by the new originations volume of loans held for investment, \\nnet of originations of sales of such loans within the period.  Because we reserve for probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio \\nupon origination, this rate is significantly impacted by the expectation of credit losses for the period’s originations volume. This \\nrate may also be impacted by changes in loss estimates for loans originated prior to the commencement of the period. \\n\\nThe denominator of the Provision Rate formula includes the new originations volume of loans held for investment, net of \\noriginations of sales of such loans within the period.  However, the numerator reflects only the additional provision required to \\nprovide for loan losses on the net funded amount during such period.  Therefore, all other things equal, an increased volume of \\nloan rollovers and line of credit repayments and re-borrowings in a period will reduce the Provision Rate.\\n\\nA portion of loans regularly sold through OnDeck Marketplace are or may be loans which were initially designated as held \\nfor investment upon origination. The portion of such loans sold in a given period may vary materially depending upon market \\nconditions and other circumstances.\\n\\nThe Provision Rate is not directly comparable to the net cumulative lifetime charge-off ratio because (i) the Provision Rate \\nreflects estimated losses at the time of origination while the net cumulative lifetime charge-off ratio reflects actual charge-offs, \\n(ii) the Provision Rate includes provisions for losses on both term loans and lines of credit while the net cumulative lifetime charge-\\noff ratio reflects only charge-offs related to term loans and (iii) the Provision Rate for a period reflects the provision for losses \\nrelated to all loans held for investment while the net cumulative lifetime charge-off ratio reflects lifetime charge-offs of term loans \\nrelated to a particular cohort of term loans.\\n\\nReserve Ratio\\n\\nReserve Ratio is our allowance for loan losses as of the end of the period divided by the Unpaid Principal Balance as of the \\nend of the period.\\n\\n15+ Day Delinquency Ratio\\n\\n15+ Day Delinquency Ratio equals the aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance for our loans that are 15 or more calendar days \\npast due as of the end of the period as a percentage of the Unpaid Principal Balance. The Unpaid Principal Balance for our loans \\nthat are 15 or more calendar days past due includes loans that are paying and non-paying. Because the majority of our loans require \\ndaily repayments, excluding weekends and holidays, they may be deemed delinquent more quickly than loans from traditional \\nlenders that require only monthly payments.\\n\\n15+ Day Delinquency Ratio is not annualized, but reflects balances as of the end of the period.\\n\\nNet Charge-off Rate\\n\\nNet Charge-off Rate is calculated as our annualized net charge-offs for the period divided by the average Unpaid Principal \\nBalance outstanding. Annualization is based on 4 quarters per year and is not business day adjusted. Net charge-offs are charged-\\noff loans in the period, net of recoveries. \\n\\nPre-Provision Operating Income \\n\\nPre-Provision Operating Income represents Income (Loss) from operations plus Provision for loan losses in the period.  Our \\nuse of Pre-Provision Operating Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a \\nsubstitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  In particular, Pre-Provision Operating Income excludes Provision \\nfor loan losses, and as a result does not reflect the estimated loss of principal associated with the failure of our customers to repay \\ntheir loans in full, which is a material cost of our business.\\n\\nPre-Provision Operating Income Yield\\n\\nPre-Provision Operating Yield represents Pre-Provision Operating Income divided by Average Interest Earning Assets, \\nannualized. Annualization is based on a 365 days per year and is calendar day adjusted.\\n\\n Our use of Pre-Provision Operating Yield has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation \\nor as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  In particular, Pre-Provision Operating Yield excludes Provision \\nfor loan losses and has the same limitations as described above for Pre-Provision Operating Income.\\n\\n\\n\\n43\\n\\nOn Deck Capital, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nConsolidated Average Balance Sheets\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2017 2016\\n\\nAssets\\nCash and cash equivalents $ 55,725 $ 85,524\\nRestricted cash 57,053 41,695\\nLoans held for investment 990,287 790,897\\nLess: Allowance for loan losses (108,829) (75,432)\\n\\nLoans held for investment, net 881,458 715,465\\nLoans held for sale 355 7,176\\nProperty, equipment and software, net 26,636 29,668\\nOther assets 17,758 20,970\\n\\nTotal assets $ 1,038,985 $ 900,498\\nLiabilities and equity\\n\\nLiabilities:\\nAccounts payable $ 3,284 $ 4,120\\nInterest payable 2,301 1,254\\nFunding debt 724,340 548,530\\nCorporate debt 16,160 8,662\\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities 33,265 33,095\\n\\nTotal liabilities 779,350 595,661\\n\\nTotal On Deck Capital, Inc. stockholders\\' equity 254,634 299,447\\nNoncontrolling interest 5,001 5,390\\n\\nTotal equity 259,635 304,837\\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 1,038,985 $ 900,498\\n\\nMemo:\\nUnpaid Principal Balance $ 972,269 $ 776,793\\nInterest Earning Assets $ 972,622 $ 783,763\\nLoans $ 990,642 $ 798,073\\n\\n Average Balance Sheet Items for the period represent the average as of the beginning of the month in the period and as \\nof the end of each month in the period.\\n\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nWe believe that the non-GAAP metrics in this report can provide useful supplemental measures for period-to-period \\ncomparisons of our core business and useful supplemental information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating \\nour operating results. However, non-GAAP metrics are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered \\nan alternative to any measures of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Other companies \\nmay calculate these non-GAAP metrics differently than we do. The reconciliations below reconcile each of our non-GAAP metrics \\nto their most comparable respective GAAP metric.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our net income (loss), adjusted to exclude interest expense associated with debt used for \\ncorporate purposes (rather than funding costs associated with lending activities), income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, \\n\\n\\n\\n44\\n\\nstock-based compensation expense and warrant liability fair value adjustments. Stock-based compensation includes employee \\ncompensation as well as compensation to third-party service providers.\\n\\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute \\nfor analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\\n \\n\\n• although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be \\nreplaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements \\nor for new capital expenditure requirements;\\n\\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\\n\\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\\n\\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest associated with debt used for corporate purposes or tax payments that may \\nrepresent a reduction in cash available to us; and\\n\\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potential costs we would incur if certain of our warrants were settled in cash.\\n\\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\\n \\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2017 2016 2015\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA\\nNet loss $ (14,345) $ (85,482) $ (2,231)\\nAdjustments:\\n\\nCorporate interest expense 764 414 306\\nIncome tax expense — — —\\nDepreciation and amortization 9,951 9,462 6,508\\nStock-based compensation expense 12,515 15,915 11,582\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 8,885 $ (59,691) $ 16,165\\n\\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income\\n\\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income represents our net loss adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and warrant \\nliability fair value adjustment, each on the same basis and with the same limitations as described above for Adjusted EBITDA. \\n\\n\\n\\n45\\n\\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted Net (Loss) Income for each of the periods indicated:\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2017 2016 2015\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net (Loss) Income\\nNet loss $ (14,345) $ (85,482) $ (2,231)\\nAdjustments:\\n\\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 2,811 2,524 958\\nStock-based compensation expense 12,515 15,915 11,582\\n\\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income $ 981 $ (67,043) $ 10,309\\n\\nNet Interest Margin\\nNet Interest Margin, is calculated as annualized Net Interest Income divided by average Interest Earning Assets.

Deferred origination costs are limited to costs directly attributable to originating loans such as commissions, \\nvendor costs and personnel costs directly related to the time spent by the personnel performing activities related to loan origination. \\nFunding cost is the interest expense, fees, and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs we incur in connection with our lending \\nactivities across all of our debt facilities. Annualization is based on 365 days per year and is calendar day adjusted.\\n\\n       Our use of Net Interest Margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute \\nfor analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

We plan to continue to invest significant resources to accomplish these goals.  \\nWe anticipate that our total operating expense will increase during 2018 as we plan to continue investing in marketing, technology \\nand analytics, and our collection capabilities.  In addition, we have modified our collections strategy to retain more and sell fewer \\ncharged-off loans, with the goal of achieving higher recoveries. These investments are intended to contribute to our long-term \\ngrowth, but they may affect our near-term operating performance.\\n\\nOriginations\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 our revenues increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily \\nas a result of an increase in the average loans outstanding as well as an increase in pricing on our 2017 originations.  During the \\nyears ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we originated $2.1 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion of loans, respectively, \\nThe decrease in originations in 2017 was largely due to the tightening of our credit policies used to determine eligibility, pricing \\nand loan size for certain customers which resulted in us offering smaller loans or declining to extend credit to certain customers.  \\nWe decided to tighten our credit policies in order to better control credit risk, reduce our loss rates, and increase our margins with \\nthe understanding that the tightening would reduce originations.  Despite the decrease in originations in 2017, the average loans \\noutstanding, which is the foundation of our interest earning potential, increased relative to 2016 given each year\\'s respective \\nbeginning balances and the effect of our strategic decision to retain more loans on our balance sheet beginning in 2016.  In addition, \\nduring 2017 we continued to grow our line of credit originations, which made up 19.8%, 14.6% and 9.1% of total dollar originations \\nin 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \\n\\nThe number of weekends and holidays in a period can impact our business. Many small businesses tend to apply for loans \\non weekdays, and their businesses may be closed at least part of a weekend and on holidays. In addition, our loan fundings and \\nautomated customer loan repayments only occur on weekdays (excluding bank holidays).\\n\\nWe anticipate that our future growth will continue to depend in part on attracting new customers.  As we continue to aggregate \\ndata on customers and prospective customers, we seek to use that data and our increasing knowledge to optimize our marketing \\nspending to attract these customers as well as to continue to focus our analytics resources on better identifying potential customers. \\nWe have historically relied on all three of our channels for customer acquisition but remain focused on growing our direct and \\nstrategic partner channels. Collective originations through our direct and strategic partner channels made up 73%, 73% and 72%\\nof total originations from all customers in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We plan to continue investing in direct marketing \\nand sales, increasing our brand awareness and growing our strategic partnerships.\\n\\nThe following table summarize the percentage of loans made to all customers originated by our three distribution channels \\nfor the periods indicated. From time to time management is required to make judgments to determine customers\\' appropriate \\nchannel distribution.\\n  \\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\nPercentage of Originations (Dollars) 2017 2016 2015\\n\\nDirect and Strategic Partner 73.1% 72.7% 72.0%\\nFunding Advisor 26.9% 27.3% 28.0%\\n\\nWe originate term loans and lines of credit to customers who are new to OnDeck as well as to repeat customers. New \\noriginations are defined as new term loan originations plus all line of credit draws in the period, including subsequent draws on \\nexisting lines of credit. Renewal originations include term loans only. We believe our ability to increase adoption of our loans \\nwithin our existing customer base will be important to our future growth.  A component of our future growth will include increasing \\nthe length of our customer life cycle by expanding our product offerings.  In 2017, 2016, and 2015 originations from our repeat \\ncustomers, were 52%, 53% and 57%, respectively, of total originations to all customers.  We believe our significant number of \\nrepeat customers is primarily due to our high levels of customer service and continued improvement in our types of loans and \\nservices. Repeat customers generally show improvements in several key metrics.  From our 2015 customer cohort, customers who \\ntook at least three loans grew their revenue and bank balance, respectively, on average by 37% and 50% from their initial loan to \\ntheir third loan.  Similarly, from our 2016 customer cohort, customers who took at least three loans grew their revenue and bank \\n\\n\\n\\n48\\n\\nbalance, respectively, on average by 35% and 42%. In 2017, 27.7% of our origination volume from repeat customers was due to \\nunpaid principal balance rolled from existing loans directly into such repeat originations. In order for a current customer to qualify \\nfor a new term loan while a term loan payment obligation remains outstanding, the customer must pass the following standards:\\n \\n\\n• the business must be approximately 50% paid down on its existing loan;\\n\\n• the business must be current on its outstanding OnDeck loan with no material delinquency history; and\\n\\n• the business must be fully re-underwritten and determined to be of adequate credit quality.\\n\\nThe extent to which we generate repeat business from our customers will be an important factor in our continued revenue \\ngrowth and our visibility into future revenue. In conjunction with repeat borrowing activity, many of our customers also tend to \\nincrease their subsequent loan size compared to their initial loan size.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the percentage of loans originated by new and repeat customers. Loans from cross-\\nselling efforts are classified in the table as repeat loans.\\n \\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\nPercentage of Originations (Dollars) 2017 2016 2015\\n\\nNew 47.6% 47.0% 42.6%\\nRepeat 52.4% 53.0% 57.4%\\n\\nCredit Performance\\n\\nCredit performance refers to how a portfolio of loans performs relative to expectations.  Generally speaking, perfect credit \\nperformance is a loan that is repaid in full and in accordance with the terms of the agreement, meaning that all amounts due were \\nrepaid in full and on time.  However, no portfolio is without risk and a certain amount of losses are expected.  In this respect, credit \\nperformance must be assessed relative to pricing and expectations. Because a certain degree of losses are expected, pricing will \\nbe determined with the goal of allowing for estimated losses while still generating the desired rate of return after taking into account \\nthose estimated losses.  When a portfolio has higher than estimated losses, the desired rate of return may not be achieved and that \\nportfolio would be considered to have underperformed.  Conversely, if the portfolio incurred lower than estimated losses, resulting \\nin a higher than expected rate of return, the portfolio would be considered to have overperformed.\\n\\nWe originate and price our loans expecting that we will incur a degree of losses.  When we originate our loans, we record \\na provision for estimated loan losses.  As we gather more data as the portfolio performs, we may increase or decrease that reserve \\nas deemed necessary to reflect our latest loss estimate.  Some portions of our loan portfolio may be performing better than expected \\nwhile other portions may perform below expectations.  The net result of the underperforming and overperforming portfolio segments \\ndetermines if we require an overall increase or decrease to our loan reserve related to those existing loans.  A net decrease to the \\nloan reserve related to the existing loans tends to reduce provision expense, while a net increase to the loan reserve tends to increase \\nprovision expense.\\n\\nIn accordance with our strategy to expand the range of our loan offerings, over time, we have expanded the offerings of our \\nterm loans by making available longer terms and larger amounts.  When we begin to offer a new type of loan, we typically \\nextrapolate our existing data to create an initial version of a credit model to permit us to underwrite and price the new type of loan.  \\nThereafter, we begin to collect actual performance data on these new loans which allows us to refine our credit model based on \\nactual data as opposed to extrapolated data.  It often takes several quarters after we begin offering a new type of loan for that loan \\nto be originated in sufficient volume to generate a critical mass of performance data.  In addition, for loans with longer terms, it \\ntakes longer to acquire significant amounts of data because the loans take longer to season.\\n\\nDuring 2016, we accumulated additional data on certain longer term loans as more of them began to season.  We used this \\ndata to back test our estimates and model assumptions for these longer term loans.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, our analysis \\nconcluded that our credit model was under predicting losses, in the aggregate, for our loans that were 15 months or more in term \\nlength at origination. Terms loans meeting this criteria made up approximately 44% of the outstanding principal balance on our \\nbalance sheet at December 31, 2016. \\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, our provision for loan loss expense included approximately $19 million of additional expense \\nrequired to build our reserve based on our latest estimate of losses for loans with original maturities of 15 months or longer.  The \\n$19 million increase related almost entirely to 2016 originations.  Our provision rate for 2016 was 7.4% as compared to 5.8% in \\n2015.\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\nIn 2017, our corrective action included the tightening of credit policies used to determine eligibility, pricing and loan size \\nfor certain customers. As additional seasoning took place on our loans and as our predictive model incorporated newer data, our \\nprovision rate generally improved during 2017.  Our Provision Rates were 8.7%, 7.2%, 7.5% (6.9% excluding approximately 65 \\nbasis points attributable to hurricanes Harvey and Irma) and 6.4% in the first through fourth quarters of 2017, respectively.  For \\nthe full year 2017, the Provision Rate was 7.5% compared to 7.4% for 2016. We believe this represents an improvement because  \\nthe 2017 Provision Rate includes additional reserve build related to 2016 originations and hurricanes Harvey and Irma. \\n\\nPricing\\n\\nCustomer pricing is determined primarily based on the customer’s OnDeck Score, loan type (term loan or line of credit), \\nthe term loan duration, the customer type (new or repeat) and origination channel. Loans originated through the direct and strategic \\npartner channels are generally priced lower than loans originated through the funding advisor channel due to the higher commissions \\npaid to funding advisors.  \\n\\nOur customers generally pay between $0.003 and $0.04 per month in interest for every dollar they borrow under one of our \\nterm loans, with the actual amount typically driven by the length of term of the particular loan. Historically, our term loans have \\nbeen primarily quoted in “Cents on Dollar,” or COD, and lines of credit in annual percentage rate, or APR. Given the use case \\nand payback period associated with our shorter term loans, we believe many of our customers prefer to understand pricing on a \\n“dollars in, dollars out” basis and are primarily focused on total payback cost.\\n\\n“Cents on Dollar” borrowed reflects the total interest to be paid by a customer to us for each dollar of principal borrowed, \\nand does not include the loan origination fee.  As of December 31, 2017, the APRs of our term loans outstanding ranged from \\n5.9% to 99.7% and the APRs of our lines of credit outstanding ranged from 11.0% to 60.8%.  Because many of our loans are short \\nterm in nature and APR is calculated on an annualized basis, we believe that small business customers tend to understand and \\nevaluate term loans, especially those of a year or less, primarily on a Cents on Dollar borrowed basis rather than APR.  While \\nannualized rates like APR may help a borrower compare loans of similar duration, especially for loans of 12 months or less, an \\nannualized rate may be less useful because it is sensitive to duration.  For loans of 12 months or less, small differences in loan \\nterm can yield large changes in the associated APR, which makes comparisons and understanding of total interest cost more \\ndifficult.  We believe that for such short-term loans, Cents on Dollar, or similar cost measures that provide total interest expense, \\ngive a borrower important information to understand and compare loans, and make an educated decision.  Despite these limitations, \\nwe are exploring ways to increase standardization of pricing and comparison terms in our industry in order to help small business \\ncustomers assess their credit options.  We are also providing APRs for prior periods as supplemental information for comparative \\npurposes.  Historically, we have not used APR as an internal metric to evaluate performance of our business or as a basis to \\ncompensate our employees or to measure their performance. The interest on commercial business loans is also tax deductible as \\npermitted by law compared to typical personal loans which do not provide a tax deduction. APR does not give effect to the small \\nbusiness customer’s possible tax deductions and cash savings associated with business related interest expenses.\\n\\nWe believe that our product pricing has historically fallen between traditional bank loans to small businesses and certain \\nnon-bank small business financing alternatives such as merchant cash advances.\\n\\nQ4 2017 Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013\\n\\nWeighted Average Term Loan \"Cents\\non Dollar\" Borrowed, per Month 1.97¢ 1.96¢ 1.94¢ 1.95¢ 1.82¢ 1.95¢ 2.32¢ 2.65¢\\n\\nWeighted Average APR - Term Loans\\nand Lines of Credit 43.8% 43.8% 43.2% 44.0% 41.4% 44.5% 54.4% 63.4%\\n\\nThe weighted average APR for term loans and lines of credit prior to 2017 had generally declined for several years.  For the \\nyears ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average APR for term loans and lines of credit was 43.7%, 41.4%\\nand 44.5%, respectively.  We attribute the pricing decrease between 2015 and 2016 to longer average loan term lengths, increased \\noriginations from our lower cost direct and strategic partner channels as a percentage of total originations, the growth of our line \\nof credit product which is priced at a lower APR level than our term loans, the introduction of our customer loyalty program and \\nour continued efforts to pass savings on to customers.  The pricing increases in 2017 were primarily due to our decision to generally \\nraise prices compared to the prior year..\\n\\nWe consider Effective Interest Yield, or EIY, as a key pricing metric. EIY is the rate of return we achieve on loans outstanding \\nduring a period. Our EIY differs from APR in that it takes into account deferred origination fees and deferred origination costs. \\n\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\nDeferred origination fees include fees paid up front to us by customers when loans are originated and decrease the carrying value \\nof loans, thereby increasing the EIY. Deferred origination costs are limited to costs directly attributable to originating loans such \\nas commissions, vendor costs and personnel costs directly related to the time spent by the personnel performing activities related \\nto loan origination and increase the carrying value of loans, thereby decreasing the Effective Interest Yield.\\n\\nIn addition to individual loan pricing and the number of days in a period, there are many other factors that can affect EIY, \\nincluding:\\n\\n• Channel Mix - In general, loans originated from the direct and strategic partner channels have lower EIYs than loans \\nfrom the funding advisor channel.  This is primarily due to the lower pricing of loans in the direct and strategic partner \\nchannels, which reflect lower acquisition costs and lower loss rates compared to loans in the funding advisor channel.  \\nThe direct and strategic partner channels\\' have, in the aggregate, made up 73%, 73% and 72% of total originations during \\nthe years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We expect the combined direct and strategic partner \\nchannels\\', as well as the funding advisor channel\\'s, percentage of originations in 2018 to remain generally comparable \\nto 2017 levels.\\n\\n• Term Mix - In general, term loans with longer durations have lower annualized interest rates.  Despite lower EIYs, total \\nrevenues from customers with longer loan durations are typically higher than the revenue of customers with shorter-term, \\nhigher EIY loans because total payback is typically higher compared to a shorter length term for the same principal loan \\namount.  Following the introduction of our 24-month and 36-month term loans, the average length of new term loan \\noriginations had increased from 10.8 months at December 31, 2014 to 13.3 months at December 31, 2016.  As part of \\nour 2017 credit tightening policy, when appropriate, the offered duration of term loans to certain customers was shortened \\nto control duration risk.  For the three-months ended December 31, 2017, the average length of new term loan originations \\nhad decreased to 11.7 months.\\n\\n• Customer Type Mix - In general, loans originated from repeat customers historically have had lower EIYs than loans \\nfrom new customers.  This is primarily due to the fact that repeat customers typically have a higher OnDeck Score and \\nare therefore deemed to be lower risk.  In addition, repeat customers are more likely to be approved for longer terms than \\nnew customers given their established payment history and lower risk profiles. Finally, origination fees are generally \\nreduced or waived for repeat customers due to our loyalty program, contributing to lower EIYs.  \\n\\n• Product Mix - In general, loans originated by line of credit customers have lower EIYs than loans from term loan \\ncustomers.  This is primarily due to the fact that lines of credit are expected to have longer lifetime usage than term loans, \\nenabling more time to recoup upfront acquisition costs.  For the year ended 2017, the average line of credit APR was \\n32.3%, compared to the average term loan APR which was 45.2%.  Further, draws by line of credit customers have \\nincreased to 19.8% of total originations in 2017 from 14.6% in 2016. \\n\\n• Competition - During 2016 and 2017, we believe the number of new entrants into the market as well as the amount of \\nfunding invested in these competitors from private equity or venture capital sources slowed.  At the same time, more \\ntraditional small business lenders such as banks have and may continue to enter the space. Additionally, certain non-bank \\nsmall business service providers are launching lending products aimed at their small business customers. As these trends \\nevolve, competitors may attempt to obtain new customers by pricing term loans and lines of credit below prevailing \\nmarket rates. This could cause downward pricing pressure as these new entrants attempt to win new customers even at \\nthe cost of pricing loans below market rates, or even at rates resulting in net losses to them. . However, in the second half \\nof 2017, we increased our pricing  to optimize our unit economics while growing originations again sequentially, and \\ncontinue to believe that price is just  one of a number of selection criteria small business owners use to evaluate their \\nfinancing options. \\n\\nEffective Interest Yield\\nQ4 2017 Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013\\n35.6% 33.4% 32.8% 33.9% 33.3% 35.4% 40.3% 43.5%\\n\\nSale of Whole Loans through OnDeck Marketplace\\n\\nWe sell whole loans to institutional investors through OnDeck Marketplace. Marketplace originations are defined as loans \\nthat are sold through OnDeck Marketplace in the period or are held for sale at the end of the period. For the years ended 2017, \\n2016 and 2015 approximately 3.7%, 18.4% and 34.3% respectively, of total term loan originations were designated as Marketplace\\n\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\noriginations, which resulted in $74.2 million, $378.5 million and $617.7 million of loans sold, respectively.  We have the ability \\nto fund our originations through a variety of funding sources, including OnDeck Marketplace. Due to the flexibility of our diversified \\nfunding model, management has the ability to exercise judgment to adjust the percentage of term loans originated through OnDeck \\nMarketplace considering numerous factors including the premiums, if any, available to us.  During the year ended 2017, premiums \\nincreased due, in part, to market conditions and the loan mix we elected to sell.  However, the Marketplace Gain on Sale Rate \\nduring the year ended 2017 decreased to 3.4% compared to 3.8% for the year ended 2016 primarily as a result of the channel mix \\nof the loans sold.  Despite these trends, we elected to make OnDeck Marketplace loan sales during 2017 to provide us an additional \\nsource of liquidity and to maintain active relationships with our institutional loan purchasers.  If premiums remain steady or \\ndecrease further, we may further reduce our percentage of Marketplace originations or suspend such originations.  However, \\nsubject to our overall financing and liquidity needs as well as the eligibility to finance new originations under our existing debt \\nfacilities, we may use or increase our use of OnDeck Marketplace regardless of whether premiums increase or decrease.\\n\\nTo the extent our use of OnDeck Marketplace as a funding source increases or decreases in the future, our gross revenue \\nand net revenue could be materially affected.  The sale of whole loans generates gain on sales of loans which is recognized in the \\nperiod the loan is sold.  In contrast, holding loans on balance sheet generates interest income and funding costs over the term of \\nthe loans and generally generates a provision for loan loss expense in the period of origination. Typically, over the life of a loan, \\nwe generate more total revenue and income from loans we hold on our balance sheet to maturity as compared to loans we sell \\nthrough OnDeck Marketplace.\\n\\nOur OnDeck Marketplace originations come from one of the following two origination sources:\\n\\n• New loans which are designated at origination to be sold, referred to as “Originations of loans held for sale;” and\\n\\n• Loans which were originally designated as held for investment that are subsequently designated to be sold at the time of \\ntheir renewal and which are considered modified loans, referred to as “Originations of loans held for investment, modified.\"\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the initial principal of originations of the aforementioned two sources as it relates to the \\nstatement of cash flows during 2017, 2016 and 2015.\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2017 2016 2015 1\\n\\nOriginations of loans held for sale 49,813 304,258 445,968\\nOriginations of loans held for investment, modified 13,252 72,839 138,968\\n    Marketplace originations 63,065 377,097 584,936\\n\\n1 The twelve months ended December 31, 2015 excludes the sale of $32.8 million of loans held for investment, which were not initially \\ndesignated for sale at origination or upon renewal.\\n\\nCustomer Acquisition Costs\\n\\nOur customer acquisition costs, or CACs, differ depending upon the acquisition channel. CACs in our direct channel include \\nthe commissions paid to our internal sales force and expenses associated with items such as direct mail, social media and other \\nonline marketing activities. CACs in our strategic partner channel include commissions paid to our internal sales force and strategic \\npartners. CACs in our funding advisor channel include commissions paid to our internal sales force and funding advisors. CACs \\nin all channels include new originations as well as renewals. \\n\\nOur CACs, on a combined basis for all three acquisition channels and evaluated as a percentage of originations, declined \\nfor the year ended 2017 as compared to the year ended 2016.  The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in CACs in our \\ndirect channel resulting from improvements in customer targeting, increased drawn balances of our customers\\' lines of credit,   \\nincreased renewal activity within the direct channel on an absolute dollar basis as well as a decline in CACs in our strategic partner \\nchannel driven by decreased external commissions.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in CACs in our funding \\nadvisor channel driven by an increase in external commissions.\\n\\nIncreased competition for customer response could require us to incur higher customer acquisition costs and make it more \\ndifficult for us to grow our loan originations in both unit and volume for both new as well as repeat customers.\\n\\nCustomer Lifetime Value\\n\\nThe ongoing lifetime value of our customers will be an important component of our future performance. We analyze customer \\nlifetime value not only by tracking the “contribution” of customers over their lifetime with us, but also by comparing this contribution \\n\\n\\n\\n52\\n\\nto the acquisition costs incurred in connection with originating such customers’ initial loans, whether term loan, lines of credit or \\nboth.\\n\\nFor illustration, we consider customers that took their first ever loan or line of credit from us during 2015 and look at all of \\ntheir borrowing and transaction history from that date through December 31, 2017.  The borrowing characteristics of these borrowers \\ninclude:\\n \\n\\n• Average number of loans per customer during the measurement period: 2.1 \\n\\n• Average initial loan size:  $36,415 \\n\\n• Average amount borrowed per customer:  $104,272 \\n\\n• Total borrowings:  $1.88 billion \\n\\nSimilarly, the borrowing characteristics of customers that took their first ever loan or line of credit from us during 2016 include:\\n \\n\\n• Average number of loans per customer during the measurement period:  1.5 \\n\\n• Average initial loan size:  $38,533 \\n\\n• Average amount borrowed per customer:  $68,469 \\n\\n• Total borrowings:  $1.42 billion \\n\\nHistorical Charge-Offs\\n\\nWe illustrate below our historical loan losses by providing information regarding our net lifetime charge-off ratios by cohort. \\nNet lifetime charge-offs are the unpaid principal balance charged off less recoveries of loans previously charged off, and a given \\ncohort’s net lifetime charge-off ratio equals the cohort’s net lifetime charge-offs through December 31, 2017 divided by the cohort’s \\ntotal original loan volume. Repeat loans in the denominator include the full renewal loan principal, rather than the net funded \\namount, which is the renewal loan’s principal net of the unpaid principal balance on the existing loan.

In a strong economic climate, demand for our loans may increase as consumer spending increases \\nand small businesses seek to expand. In addition, more potential customers may meet our underwriting requirements to \\nqualify for a loan. At the same time, small businesses may experience improved cash flow and liquidity resulting in fewer \\ncustomers requiring loans to manage their cash flows. In that climate, traditional lenders may also approve loans for a \\nhigher percentage of our potential customers. In a weakening economic climate or recession, the opposite may occur.\\n\\n• Credit Performance. In a strong economic climate, our customers may experience improved cash flow and liquidity, \\nwhich may result in lower loan losses. In a weakening economic climate or recession, the opposite may occur. We factor \\neconomic conditions into our loan underwriting analysis and reserves for loan losses, but changes in economic conditions, \\nparticularly sudden changes, may affect our actual loan losses. These effects may be partially mitigated by the short-term \\nnature and repayment structure of our loans, which should allow us to react more quickly than if the terms of our loans \\nwere longer.\\n\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\n• Loan Losses.  Our underwriting process is designed to limit our loan losses to levels compatible with our business strategy \\nand financial model. Our aggregate loan loss rates from 2013 through 2015 were consistent with our financial targets \\nwhile 2016 was higher than our financial target as we incurred higher than estimated loss rates on certain longer-term \\nloans.  Our 2017 loan loss levels were also higher than our financial targets largely because we were taking corrective \\naction throughout the first half of the year to address the higher 2016 loan losses. Our overall loan losses are affected by \\na variety of factors, including external factors such as prevailing economic conditions, general small business sentiment \\nand unusual events such as natural disasters, as well as internal factors such as the accuracy of the OnDeck Score, the \\neffectiveness of our underwriting process and the introduction of new types of loans, such as our line of credit, with which \\nwe have less experience to draw upon when forecasting their loss rates. Our loan loss rates may vary in the future.\\n\\n• Funding Costs. Changes in macroeconomic conditions may affect generally prevailing interest rates, and such effects \\nmay be amplified or reduced by other factors such as fiscal and monetary policies, economic conditions in other markets \\nand other factors. Interest rates may also change for reasons unrelated to economic conditions. To the extent that interest \\nrates rise, our funding costs will increase and the spread between our Effective Interest Yield and our Cost of Funds Rate \\nmay narrow to the extent we cannot correspondingly increase the payback rates we charge our customers. As we have \\ngrown, we have been able to lower our Cost of Funds Rate by negotiating more favorable interest rates on our debt and \\naccessing new sources of funding, such as the OnDeck Marketplace and the securitization markets. However, we expect \\nour Cost of Funds Rate to gradually move higher in 2018 due to anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate increases.\\n\\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\nInterest Income. We generate revenue primarily through interest and origination fees earned on the term loans and lines of \\ncredit we originate. Interest income also includes interest income earned on loans held for sale from the time the loan is originated \\nuntil it is ultimately sold, as well as other miscellaneous interest income.  Our interest and origination fee revenue is amortized \\nover the term of the loan using the effective interest method. Origination fees collected but not yet recognized as revenue are netted \\nwith direct origination costs and recorded as a component of loans held for investment or loans held for sale, as appropriate, on \\nour consolidated balance sheets and recognized over the term of the loan. Direct origination costs include costs directly attributable \\nto originating a loan, including commissions, vendor costs and personnel costs directly related to the time spent by those individuals \\nperforming activities related to loan origination.\\n\\nGain on Sales of Loans. We sell term loans to third-party institutional investors through OnDeck Marketplace. We recognize \\na gain or loss on the sale of such loans as the difference between the proceeds received, adjusted for initial recognition of servicing \\nassets or liabilities obtained at the date of sale, and the outstanding principal and net deferred origination costs.  To the extent that \\npremiums available to us remain consistent with the past several quarters, we expect both the volume and percentage of loans sold \\nin 2018 to be relatively consistent with or less than, the volume of loans sold in 2017.  The Gain on Sale that will result from those \\nsales will be a function of the premiums available in 2018 which cannot be determined at this time. \\n\\nOther Revenue. Other revenue includes servicing revenue related to loans serviced for others, fair value adjustments to \\nservicing rights, platform fees, monthly fees charged to customers for our line of credit, and marketing fees earned from our issuing \\nbank partner, which are recognized as the related services are provided. \\n\\nCost of Revenue\\n\\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provision for loan losses consists of amounts charged to income during the period to maintain \\nan allowance for loan losses, or ALLL, estimated to be adequate to provide for probable credit losses inherent in our existing loan \\nportfolio. Our ALLL represents our estimate of the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of term loans and lines of credit and is \\nbased on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the portfolio, loan specific information gathered through \\nour collection efforts, delinquency levels, our historical charge-off and loss experience and general economic conditions. We \\nexpect our aggregate provision for loan losses to increase in absolute dollars as the amount of term loans and lines of credit we \\noriginate and hold for investment increases.\\n\\nFunding Costs. Funding costs consist of the interest expense we pay on the debt we incur to fund our lending activities, \\ncertain fees and the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs incurred in connection with obtaining this debt, such as banker \\nfees, origination fees and legal fees. Such costs are expensed immediately upon early extinguishment of the related debt.  Our \\nCost of Funds Rate will vary based on a variety of external factors, such as credit market conditions, general interest levels and \\ninterest rate spreads, as well as OnDeck-specific factors, such as origination volume and credit quality. We expect our funding \\n\\n\\n\\n57\\n\\ncosts will continue to increase in absolute dollars due to increased utilization of our funding debt facilities resulting from planned \\nportfolio growth and higher interest rates.\\n\\nOperating Expense\\n\\nOperating expense consists of sales and marketing, technology and analytics, processing and servicing, and general and \\nadministrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and \\noccupancy, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. The number of employees was 475 and 708 at \\nDecember 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. All operating expense categories also include an allocation of overhead, \\nsuch as rent and other overhead, which is based on employee headcount.\\n\\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists of salaries and personnel-related costs of our sales and marketing \\nand business development employees, as well as direct marketing and advertising costs, online and offline CACs (such as direct \\nmail, paid search and search engine optimization costs), public relations, radio and television advertising, promotional event \\nprograms and sponsorships, corporate communications and allocated overhead. We expect our sales and marketing expense in \\nterms of absolute dollars to remain consistent with or be modestly less than 2017 levels but to decrease as a percentage of revenue \\nin the near term as our sales and marketing activities mature and we continue to optimize marketing spend.\\n\\nTechnology and Analytics. Technology and analytics expense consists primarily of the salaries and personnel-related costs \\nof our engineering and product employees as well as our credit and analytics employees who develop our proprietary credit-scoring \\nmodels. Additional expenses include third-party data acquisition expenses, professional services, consulting costs, expenses related \\nto the development of new types of loans and technologies and maintenance of existing technology assets, amortization of \\ncapitalized internal-use software costs related to our technology platform and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest \\nin technology is essential to maintaining our competitive position, and we expect these costs to rise moderately in the near term \\non an absolute dollar basis but to decrease as a percentage of revenue.\\n\\nProcessing and Servicing. Processing and servicing expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs of our \\ncredit analysis, underwriting, funding, fraud detection, customer service and collections employees. Additional expenses include \\nvendor costs associated with third-party credit checks, lien filing fees and other costs to evaluate, close and fund loans and overhead \\ncosts. We anticipate that our processing and servicing expense in terms of absolute dollars to remain consistent with or be slightly \\nlower than 2017 levels and to decrease as a percentage of revenue as we grow originations by continuing to increase automation \\nand by driving department efficiencies.\\n\\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salary and personnel-related costs \\nfor our executive, finance and accounting, legal and people operations employees. Additional expenses include a provision for \\nthe unfunded portion of our lines of credit, consulting and professional fees, insurance, legal, travel, gain or loss on foreign exchange \\nand other corporate expenses. These expenses also include costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and \\nother regulations governing public companies, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and increased accounting costs. We \\nanticipate that our general and administrative expense in terms of absolute dollars to remain consistent with 2017 levels but to \\ndecline as a percentage of revenue in the near term as our finance and accounting, legal and people operations functions mature.\\n\\nOther (Expense) Income\\n\\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest expense and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs incurred on \\ndebt associated with our corporate activities. It does not include interest expense incurred on debt associated with our lending \\nactivities. \\n\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\n\\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes, if any. Through December 31, 2016, we \\nhave not been required to pay U.S. federal or state income taxes nor any foreign taxes because of our current and accumulated net \\noperating losses. As of December 31, 2017, we had $82.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $81.3 million \\nof state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, unless limited due to historical or future \\nownership changes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2029.\\n\\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net \\noperating losses and other tax attributes in the event of an “ownership change” of a corporation. Events which may cause limitation \\nin the amount of the net operating losses and other tax attributes that are able to be utilized in any one year include, but are not \\nlimited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period, which has occurred as a result of historical \\nownership changes. Accordingly, our ability to use pre-change net operating loss and certain other attributes are limited as prescribed \\nunder Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Therefore, if we earn net taxable income in the future, our ability to reduce our federal \\n\\n\\n\\n58\\n\\nincome tax liability with our existing net operating losses is subject to limitation. Future offerings, as well as other future ownership \\nchanges that may be outside our control could potentially result in further limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating \\nloss and tax attributes. Accordingly, achieving profitability may not result in a full release of the valuation allowance.\\n\\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, was enacted which made significant changes to \\nthe existing tax code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years \\nbeginning after December 31, 2017, an increase in bonus depreciation and the deductibility of certain depreciable assets, limitations \\non the deductibility of net interest expense, changes to net operating loss carryover and carryback rules, the transition of U.S \\ninternational taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and reductions in the amount of executive pay that could \\nqualify as a tax deduction.\\n\\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax \\nCuts and Jobs Act, or SAB 118, to assist registrants in accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act specifically when an accounting \\nanalysis of the Tax Act is incomplete for registrant\\'s financial statements for the reporting period in which the Tax Act became \\nlaw.  SAB 118 permits us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the \\nenactment date.  In accordance with SAB 118, we have been able to reasonably estimate the effect the change in the corporate tax \\nrate will have on our deferred tax asset.  At December 31, 2017, our deferred tax asset has been provisionally remeasured and \\nadjusted by $18.8 million from $56.6 million to $37.8 million.  Because a full valuation allowance has been and will continue to \\nbe recorded against our deferred tax asset, an amount corresponding to the reduction of the deferred tax asset has been released \\nfrom the valuation allowance.  These two adjustments offset each other and result in no net impact to our results of operations.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2017, a full valuation allowance of $37.8 million was recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\\n\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\nResults of Operations\\n\\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.\\n \\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2017 2016 2015\\n\\n(dollars in thousands)\\n\\nRevenue:\\nInterest income $ 334,575 $ 264,844 $ 195,048\\nGain on sales of loans 2,485 14,411 53,354\\nOther revenue 13,890 12,062 6,365\\n\\nGross revenue 350,950 291,317 254,767\\nCost of revenue:\\n\\nProvision for loan losses 152,926 149,963 74,863\\nFunding costs 45,435 32,448 20,244\\n\\nTotal cost of revenue 198,361 182,411 95,107\\nNet revenue 152,589 108,906 159,660\\nOperating expense:\\n\\nSales and marketing 52,786 67,011 60,575\\nTechnology and analytics 53,392 58,899 42,653\\nProcessing and servicing 18,076 19,719 13,053\\nGeneral and administrative 41,916 48,345 45,304\\n\\nTotal operating expense 166,170 193,974 161,585\\nIncome (loss) from operations (13,581) (85,068) (1,925)\\nOther expense:\\n\\nInterest expense (764) (414) (306)\\nTotal other expense (764) (414) (306)\\nLoss before provision for income taxes (14,345) (85,482) (2,231)\\nProvision for income taxes — — —\\nNet income (loss) $ (14,345) $ (85,482) $ (2,231)\\n\\n\\n\\n60\\n\\nThe consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of gross revenue for each of the periods indicated.\\n \\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2017 2016 2015\\n\\nRevenue:\\nInterest income 95.3 % 90.9 % 76.6 %\\nGain on sales of loans 0.7 5.0 20.9\\nOther revenue 4.0 4.1 2.5\\n\\nGross revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0\\nCost of revenue:\\n\\nProvision for loan losses 43.6 51.5 29.4\\nFunding costs 12.9 11.1 7.9\\n\\nTotal cost of revenue 56.5 62.6 37.3\\nNet revenue 43.5 37.4 62.7\\nOperating expense:\\n\\nSales and marketing 15.0 23.0 23.8\\nTechnology and analytics 15.2 20.2 16.7\\nProcessing and servicing 5.2 6.8 5.1\\nGeneral and administrative 11.9 16.6 17.8\\n\\nTotal operating expense 47.3 66.6 63.4\\nIncome (loss) from operations (3.8) (29.2) (0.8)\\nOther expense:\\n\\nInterest expense (0.2) (0.1) (0.1)\\nTotal other expense (0.2) (0.1) (0.1)\\nLoss before provision for income taxes (4.0) (29.3) (0.9)\\nProvision for income taxes — — —\\nNet income (loss) (4.0)% (29.3)% (0.9)%\\n\\n\\n\\n61\\n\\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 \\n \\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\nPeriod-to-Period\\n\\n2017 2016 Change\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nPercentage of\\nGross\\n\\nRevenue Amount\\n\\nPercentage of\\nGross\\n\\nRevenue Amount Percentage\\n(dollars in thousands)\\n\\nRevenue:\\nInterest income $ 334,575 95.3 % $ 264,844 90.9 % $ 69,731 26.3 %\\nGain on sales of loans 2,485 0.7 14,411 5.0 (11,926) (82.8)\\nOther revenue 13,890 4.0 12,062 4.1 1,828 15.2\\n\\nGross revenue 350,950 100.0 291,317 100.0 59,633 20.5\\nCost of revenue:\\n\\nProvision for loan losses 152,926 43.6 149,963 51.5 2,963 2.0\\nFunding costs 45,435 12.9 32,448 11.1 12,987 40.0\\n\\nTotal cost of revenue 198,361 56.5 182,411 62.6 15,950 8.7\\nNet revenue 152,589 43.5 108,906 37.4 43,683 40.1\\nOperating expenses:\\n\\nSales and marketing 52,786 15.0 67,011 23.0 (14,225) (21.2)\\nTechnology and analytics 53,392 15.2 58,899 20.2 (5,507) (9.3)\\nProcessing and servicing 18,076 5.2 19,719 6.8 (1,643) (8.3)\\nGeneral and administrative 41,916 11.9 48,345 16.6 (6,429) (13.3)\\n\\nTotal operating expenses 166,170 47.3 193,974 66.6 (27,804) (14.3)\\nLoss from operations (13,581) (3.8) (85,068) (29.2) 71,487 84.0\\nOther expense:\\n\\nInterest expense (764) (0.2) (414) (0.1) (350) 84.5\\nTotal other expense: (764) (0.2) (414) (0.1) (350) 84.5\\nLoss before provision for income\\ntaxes (14,345) (4.0) (85,482) (29.3) 71,137 (83.2)\\nProvision for income taxes — — — — — —\\nNet loss $ (14,345) (4.0)% $ (85,482) (29.3)% $ 71,137 (83.2)%\\n\\nRevenue\\n \\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\nPeriod-to-Period\\n\\n2017 2016 Change\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nPercentage of\\nGross\\n\\nRevenue Amount\\n\\nPercentage of\\nGross\\n\\nRevenue Amount Percentage\\n(dollars in thousands)\\n\\nRevenue:\\nInterest income $ 334,575 95.3% $ 264,844 90.9% $ 69,731 26.3%\\nGain on sales of loans 2,485 0.7 14,411 5.0 (11,926) (82.8)\\nOther revenue 13,890 4.0 12,062 4.1 1,828 15.2\\n\\nGross revenue $ 350,950 100.0% $ 291,317 100.0% $ 59,633 20.5%\\n\\n\\n\\n62\\n\\nGross revenue increased by $59.6 million, or 20.5%, from $291.3 million in 2016 to $351.0 million in 2017. This growth \\nwas in part attributable to a $69.7 million, or 26.3%, increase in interest income, which was driven by a greater volume of loans \\nbeing held on our balance sheet as evidenced by the 24.1% increase in Average Loans to $990.6 million from $798.1 million. The \\nincrease in interest income was also attributed to an increase in our EIY on loans outstanding to 33.9% from 33.3% over the same \\nperiod.\\n\\nGain on sales of loans decreased by $11.9 million, from $14.4 million in 2016 to $2.5 million in 2017.

Provision for loan losses increased by $3.0 million, or 2%, from $150.0 million in 2016 to $152.9 \\nmillion in 2017. In accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenue on loans over their term, but provide for probable credit losses \\non the loans at the time they are originated. We then periodically adjust our estimate of those probable credit losses based on actual \\nperformance and changes in loss estimates. As a result, we believe that analyzing provision for loan losses as a percentage of \\noriginations held for investment, rather than as a percentage of gross revenue, provides more useful insight into our operating \\nperformance. Our provision for loan losses as a percentage of originations held for investment, or the Provision Rate, increased \\nfrom 7.4% in 2016 to 7.5% in 2017.  The increase in the Provision Rate was, in part, attributable to continued reserve builds in \\n2017 for loans originated in 2016, as well as reserve builds related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma (See Part II -Item 7 - Key Factors \\nAffecting our Performance - Credit Performance.)\\n\\nFunding Costs. Funding costs increased by $13.0 million, or 40.0%, from $32.4 million in 2016 to $45.4 million in 2017. \\nThe increase in funding costs was primarily attributable to the increases in our average aggregate outstanding borrowings. The \\nAverage Funding Debt Outstanding during 2017 was $724.3 million as compared to $548.5 million during 2016 while our Cost \\nof Funds Rate increased to 6.3% from 5.9%.  The Cost of Funds Rate increased primarily as a result of the increase in LIBOR \\nthroughout 2017 which increased the rates associated with our variable rate debt instruments, and the higher interest rates associated \\nwith our newer facilities which were available to finance our previously ineligible loans. As a percentage of gross revenue, funding \\ncosts increased from 11.1% in 2016 to 12.9% in 2017.

The combined effect of our increase in \\noriginations and decreased utilization of OnDeck Marketplace resulted in a greater volume of loans being held on our balance \\nsheet as evidenced by the 44.9% increase in Average Loans to $798.1 million from $550.6 million.

Provision for loan losses increased by $75.1 million, or 100%, from $74.9 million in 2015 to \\n$150.0 million in 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in originations of term loans and lines of credit \\noriginated and held for investment. In accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenue on loans over their term, but provide for \\nprobable credit losses on the loans at the time they are originated. We then periodically adjust our estimate of those probable credit \\nlosses based on actual performance and changes in loss estimates. As a result, we believe that analyzing provision for loan losses \\nas a percentage of originations, rather than as a percentage of gross revenue, provides more useful insight into our operating \\nperformance.  Our provision for loan losses as a percentage of originations held for investment, or the Provision Rate, increased \\nfrom 5.8% in 2015 to 7.4% in 2016.  The increase in the Provision Rate was, in part, the result of an increase in loss reserves in \\n2016 related to our term loans with original maturities of 15 months or more (See Part II -Item 7 - Key Factors Affecting our \\nPerformance - Credit Performance.)  In addition, the 2015 Provision Rate was at near-historical lows due to the year\\'s better than \\naverage credit environment as well as sales of certain longer - term loans to investors through OnDeck Marketplace.\\n\\nFunding Costs. Funding costs increased by $12.2 million, or 60.3%, from $20.2 million in 2015 to $32.4 million in 2016. \\nThe increase in funding costs was primarily attributable to the increases in our aggregate outstanding borrowings. The Average \\nFunding Debt Outstanding during 2016 was $548.5 million as compared to $366.0 million during 2015 while our Cost of Funds \\nRate increased to 5.9% from 5.5%.   The Cost of Funds Rate increased as a result of the increase in LIBOR throughout 2016 which \\nincreased the rates associated with our variable rate debt instruments, the closing of our second securitization in the second quarter \\nof 2016 which was at a rate approximately 1.3% higher than the previous securitization, and the higher interest rates associated \\nwith our newer facilities which were available to finance our previously ineligible loans.  As a percentage of gross revenue, funding \\ncosts increased from 7.9% in 2015 to 11.1% in 2016. The increase in funding costs as a percentage of gross revenue was the result \\nof increased loan originations and a greater portion of those loan originations being financed and held on our balance sheet which \\nincreased the numerator of the calculation. In addition, the decrease in the gain on sale rate, the decrease in the volume of loans \\nsold through OnDeck Marketplace, and the decrease in our EIY decreased the denominator of the calculation.\\n\\n\\n\\n67\\n\\nOperating Expense\\n\\nOnDeck incurred a $1.8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with an approximately 11% reduction \\nin total headcount as part of a cost rationalization program involving both layoffs and actual and scheduled attrition.  The \\ncharge was allocated among the four operating expense categories below based on the department assignment of the impacted \\nemployees.  Approximately $1.1 million of the charge was associated with Technology and Analytics and the balance was \\nassociated with the three other operating expense categories below. \\n\\nSales and Marketing\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\nPeriod-to-Period\\n\\n2016 2015 Change\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nPercentage of\\nGross\\n\\nRevenue Amount\\n\\nPercentage of\\nGross\\n\\nRevenue Amount Percentage\\n(dollars in thousands)\\n\\nSales and marketing $ 67,011 23.0% $ 60,575 23.8% $ 6,436 10.6%\\n\\nSales and marketing expense increased by $6.4 million, or 11%, from $60.6 million in 2015 to $67.0 million in 2016.

We incurred a $1.5 million increase in \\nconsulting, legal, recruiting, accounting and other miscellaneous expenses in 2016 as we continue our transition from a private to \\na growing public company. The increases were offset by a decrease in the reserve on unfunded lines of credit of $3.2 million in \\n2016 related to potential future losses on the unfunded portion of our lines of credit. Our loss related to foreign currency transactions \\nand holdings associated with the increase in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar decreased by $1.5 million\\nin 2016 as compared to the prior year.\\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nSources of Liquidity\\n\\nDuring 2017, we originated $2.1 billion of loans utilizing a diversified set of funding sources, including cash on hand, third-\\nparty lenders (through debt facilities and securitization), OnDeck Marketplace and the cash generated by our operating, investing \\nand financing activities.\\n\\nCash on Hand\\n\\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $71 million of cash on hand to fund our future operations compared to \\napproximately $80 million at December 31, 2016.

The debt facilities contain thresholds, known as concentration limitations, which restrict a debt \\nfacility’s collateral pool from being overly concentrated with loans that share pre-defined loan characteristics. In addition, debt \\nfacilities contain provision that limit the eligibility criteria of loans that may be financed, such as term length, loan amount and a \\nborrower\\'s home country. Loans that do not meet the criteria to be financed are referred to as ineligible loans. To the extent such \\nconcentration limits are exceeded or loans are deemed ineligible, newly originated loans with the pre-defined loan characteristics \\nsubject to that concentration limit or eligibility criteria may not be financed despite available capacity under the debt facilities.\\n\\nOnDeck Marketplace\\n\\nOnDeck Marketplace is our proprietary whole loan sale platform that allows participating third-party institutional investors \\nto directly purchase small business loans from us.  OnDeck Marketplace participants enter into whole loan purchase agreements, \\nso as to purchase a pre-determined dollar amount of loans that satisfy certain eligibility criteria. The loans are sold to the participant \\nat a pre-determined purchase price above par. We recognize a gain or loss from OnDeck Marketplace loans when sold. We currently \\nact as servicer in exchange for a servicing fee with respect to the loans purchased by the applicable OnDeck Marketplace participant.  \\nFor the years ended 2017 and 2016, 3.7% and 18.4%, respectively, of total term loan originations were OnDeck Marketplace\\noriginations.  The proportion of loans we sell through OnDeck Marketplace largely depends on the premiums available to us.  To \\nthe extent our use of OnDeck Marketplace as a funding source decreases in the future due to lower available premiums or otherwise, \\nwe may choose to generate liquidity through our other available funding sources.  In 2018, we expect the percentage of total \\noriginations to be sold through OnDeck Marketplace to be relatively consistent with or less than the percentage sold in 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\n70\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Loans (Net of Allowance for Loan Losses), and Cash Flows\\n\\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, loans (net of ALLL) and cash flows:\\n \\n\\nAs of and for the Year Ended December 31,\\n2017 2016 2015\\n\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents $ 71,362 $ 79,554 $ 159,822\\nRestricted cash $ 43,462 $ 44,432 $ 38,463\\nLoans held for investment, net $ 843,781 $ 890,283 $ 499,431\\nCash provided by (used in):\\n\\nOperating activities $ 210,198 $ 134,251 $ 118,947\\nInvesting activities $ (156,564) $ (589,234) $ (168,415)\\nFinancing activities $ (62,496) $ 374,728 $ (10,468)\\n\\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were held primarily for working capital purposes.

The circumstances under which we effect these transactions depends on a variety of \\nfactors. In determining whether to engage in a certain voluntary purchase transactions, we consider, among other things, our \\nrelationship with the potential seller, the potential purchase price, credit profile of the target loans, our overall liquidity position \\nand possible alternative uses of cash. Although these purchases have not been material in the past, depending upon the circumstances, \\nthey could be material in the future, depending on the quantity and timing of these purchases.\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used to fund our investing activities was $156.6 million, and consisted \\nprimarily of $119.5 million of loan originations in excess of loan repayments received, $44.8 million of origination costs paid in \\nexcess of fees collected and $4.3 million for the purchase of property, equipment and software and capitalized internal-use software \\ndevelopment costs.

These uses of cash were partially offset by $2.4 million of net cash received for additional \\ninvestment by a noncontrolling interest, and $1.8 million of cash received from the issuance of common stock under the employee \\nstock purchase plan.\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by our financing activities was $374.7 million and consisted \\nprimarily of $379.1 million in net additional debt drawn down from our securitization and debt facilities, primarily associated \\nwith the increase in loan originations during the year and $6.3 million of payments of debt issuance costs offset by $2.6 million of \\ncash received from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan.\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used to fund our financing activities was $10.5 million and consisted \\nprimarily of $16.7 million in net principal repayments of our debt related to our securitization and debt facilities, primarily \\nassociated with the increase in loan originations during the year and $1.8 million of payments of IPO costs offset by $7.9 million of \\ncash received from investment by noncontrolling interests.\\n\\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\\n\\n We require substantial capital to fund our current operating and capital expenditure requirements. We expect these \\nrequirements to increase as we pursue our growth strategy. \\n\\nAs a result of our previous growth strategy, between 2014 and 2016, we increased our annual originations significantly.  Our \\noriginations were $1.2 billion in 2014, $1.9 billion in 2015 and $2.4 billion in 2016, which equates to annual year over year growth \\n\\n\\n\\n72\\n\\nrates of 152%, 28% and 12%, respectively. In 2017, our originations were $2.1 billion.  Although this is a decrease from 2016, it \\nstill required substantial capital.\\n\\nOur strategy is to continue to grow in a disciplined manner while remaining highly focused on credit quality and operating \\nleverage.  We expect our originations to grow in absolute dollars for the full year 2018 as compared to 2017. Because we will \\nremain focused on credit quality, we are also prepared to forgo lending opportunities that do not meet our credit, underwriting and \\npricing standards.  In addition, despite the continuing competition for customer response, we intend to allocate resources to continue \\nto optimize marketing and customer acquisition costs based on targeted returns on investment rather than spending inefficiently \\nin these areas to achieve incremental growth.\\n\\nWe estimate that at December 31, 2017, approximately $285 million of our own cash had been invested in our loan portfolio, \\napproximately two-thirds of which was used to fund our portfolio\\'s residual value and the remainder was used to fund ineligible \\nloans.  While investing in our portfolio\\'s residual value is a requirement of our funding model and will remain a use of cash so \\nlong as we continue to grow loan balances, the use of cash to fund ineligible loans may be mitigated if and to the extent we obtain \\nfunding capacity that permits the funding of the ineligible loans, either through debt facilities or OnDeck Marketplace.  We are \\ncurrently in various stages of discussions with multiple potential funding sources and are confident we will be able to obtain \\nadditional funding capacity although there can be no assurance that we will be successful.\\n\\nApproximately $313.2 million of our funding debt capacity will expire during 2018.  In order to maintain and grow our \\ncurrent rate of loan originations over the next twelve months, we will be required to secure additional funding.  We plan to do this \\nthrough one or more of the following sources: new asset-backed securitization transactions, new debt facilities, extensions and \\nincreases to existing debt facilities, and increases in our corporate line of credit.\\n\\nWe expect to use cash flow generated from operations, together with additional cash we may obtain by financing currently \\nineligible loans, to the extent that we are able to do so, to continue funding residual growth as our financed portfolio grows. In \\naddition, we may also finance our expected residual growth through other unused liquidity sources such as our corporate line of \\ncredit or possible additional subordinated notes in our debt facilities.\\n\\nHistorically we have been successful in accessing the asset-backed loan market on terms acceptable to us, and we anticipate \\nthat we will be able to do so into the foreseeable future.  However, if we deem the cost of accessing the asset-backed loan market \\nto be in excess of an appropriate rate, we may elect to use available cash, seek to increase the use of OnDeck Marketplace, or use \\nother financing options available to us.  Furthermore, we could decide to alter the types of loans we originate, such that more loans \\nare eligible for credit facilities, or we could decide to slow down the rate of originations.\\n\\nIn addition to pursuing funding through OnDeck Marketplace or additional debt funding sources as described above, although \\nit is not currently anticipated, depending upon the circumstances we may seek additional equity financing. The sale of equity may \\nresult in dilution to our stockholders, and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock. If we raise additional \\nfunds through the issuance of additional debt, the agreements governing such debt could contain covenants that would restrict our \\noperations and such debt would rank senior to shares of our common stock.  \\n\\nWe believe that our cash from operations, available capacity under our revolving lines of credit (and expected extensions \\nor replacements of those lines), liquidity from expected sales of loans through OnDeck Marketplace and existing cash balances, \\ntogether with additional financing we expect to be able to obtain on market terms, are sufficient to meet both our existing operating \\nand capital expenditure requirements and our currently planned growth for at least the next 12 months.   \\n\\nIt is possible that we may require capital in excess of amounts we currently anticipate.  Depending on market conditions \\nand other factors, we may not be able to obtain additional capital for our current operations or anticipated future growth on \\nreasonable terms or at all.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n73\\n\\nContractual Obligations\\n\\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt facilities and securitization facility and non-\\ncancelable leases for our office space and computer equipment. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations at \\nDecember 31, 2017. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.\\n \\n\\nPayment Due by Period\\n\\nTotal 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 Thereafter\\n(in thousands)\\n\\nContractual Obligations:\\nLong-term debt:\\n\\nFunding debt $ 690,443 $ 269,642 $ 420,801 $ — $ —\\nCorporate debt 8,000 8,000 — — —\\nInterest payments(1) 53,049 36,960 16,089 — —\\n\\nOperating leases (2) 78,732 8,633 18,495 18,107 33,497\\nPurchase obligations 17,006 6,120 5,586 5,300 —\\nTotal contractual obligations $ 847,230 $ 329,355 $ 460,971 $ 23,407 $ 33,497\\n\\n_________________________\\n(1) Interest payments on our debt facilities with variable interest rates are calculated using the interest rate as of December \\n\\n31, 2017.\\n(2) In February 2018, we terminated an operating lease for certain property in New York.  Taking such termination into effect, \\n\\nour contractual obligations related to operating leases would be reduced, in total, by approximately $17.5 million. See \\nNote 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\nThe obligations of our subsidiaries for the funding debt described above and related interest payment obligations are structured \\nto be non-recourse to On Deck Capital, Inc.\\n\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of \\nRegulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest \\nentities.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\\n\\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated \\nfinancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial \\nstatements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of \\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and \\nexpenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various \\nother assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under \\ndifferent assumptions or conditions.\\n\\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nappearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies require the most significant judgment and estimates \\nin the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nAllowance for Loan Losses\\n\\nThe allowance for loan losses, or ALLL, is established through periodic charges to the provision for loan losses. Loan losses \\nare charged against the ALLL when we believe that the future collection of principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, \\nare credited to the ALLL.\\n\\nWe evaluate the creditworthiness of our portfolio on a pooled basis, due to its composition of small, homogeneous loans \\nwith similar general credit risk characteristics and diversified among variables including industry and geography. We use a \\n\\n\\n\\n74\\n\\nproprietary forecast loss rate at origination for new loans that have not had the opportunity to make payments when they are first \\noriginated. The allowance is subjective as it requires material estimates, including such factors as historical trends, known and \\ninherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers’ ability to repay and current economic conditions. \\nOther qualitative factors considered may include items such as uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques, changes in \\nportfolio composition, seasonality, business conditions, and emerging trends. Recovery of the carrying value of loans is dependent \\nto a great extent on conditions that may be beyond our control. Any combination of the aforementioned factors may adversely \\naffect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies and loan losses and could require additional provisions for credit \\nlosses, which could impact future periods. In our opinion, we have provided adequate allowances to absorb probable credit losses \\ninherent in our loan portfolio based on available and relevant information affecting the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date.\\n\\nNonaccrual Loans and Charged-Off Loans\\n\\nWe consider a loan to be delinquent when the daily or weekly payments are one day past due, adjusted for grace days.  Grace \\ndays may be granted when we believe a specific circumstance warrants a brief period where a customer should be permitted to \\nskip a payment (or several) without being deemed delinquent, for example, a natural disaster such as Hurricanes Harvey or Irma.  \\nGrace days granted per customer typically do not exceed five days.  We do not recognize interest income on loans that are delinquent \\nand non-paying. Loans are returned to accrual status if they are brought to non-delinquent status or have performed in accordance \\nwith the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and, in our judgment, will continue to make periodic principal and \\ninterest payments as scheduled. When we determine it is probable that we will be unable to collect additional principal amounts \\non the loan the remaining Unpaid Principal Balance is charged off. Generally, charge-offs occur after the 90th day of delinquency.\\n\\nAccrual for Unfunded Loan Commitments\\n\\nIn September 2013, we introduced a line of credit product. Customers may draw on their lines of credit up to defined \\nmaximum amounts. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our off balance sheet credit exposure related to the undrawn line of credit \\nbalances was $204.6 million and $164.5 million, respectively. Similar to our ALLL, we are required to accrue for potential losses \\nrelated to these unfunded loan commitments at the time the line of credit is originated despite the fact that the customer has not \\nyet drawn these funds. Significant judgment is required to estimate both the amount that may ultimately be drawn on the lines of \\ncredit as well as the amount which would ultimately require a reserve. If additional amounts drawn or the rate of default differ \\nfrom our estimates, actual expenses could differ significantly from our original estimates. The accrual for unfunded loan \\ncommitments was $4.4 million and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in accrued \\nexpenses and other liabilities, with changes in the accrual included in general and administrative expense.\\n\\nServicing Rights\\n\\nWe record service assets or liabilities at fair value when we sell whole loans to third parties and upon such sale, we have \\nretained the rights to service those loans.  The gain or loss on the recognition of a servicing asset or liability is initially recognized \\nas a component of gain on sales of loans in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, while the \\nchange in fair value of servicing asset or liability is included in other revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and \\nComprehensive Income.  Servicing assets and liabilities are presented as a component of other assets or accrued expenses and \\nother liabilities, respectively. \\n\\nWe utilize industry-standard modeling, such as discounted cash flow models, to arrive at an estimate of fair value and may \\nutilize third-party service providers to assist in the valuation process. Significant assumptions used in valuing our servicing rights \\nare adequate compensation, discount rate, renewal rate and default rate.  The assumptions utilized to arrive at fair value are sensitive \\nto changes.  Our selection of renewal rate and default rate are based on data derived from historical trends and are inherently \\njudgmental.\\n\\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\\n\\nWe capitalize certain costs related to software developed for internal-use, primarily associated with the ongoing development \\nand enhancement of our technology platform and other internal uses. We begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when \\npreliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it \\nis probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function as intended. These costs are \\namortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally three years. Costs incurred prior to \\nmeeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in technology \\nand analytics expense on our consolidated statements of operations.\\n\\n\\n\\n75\\n\\nStock-Based Compensation\\n\\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize \\ncompensation expense for those options expected to vest over the service period of the award. Calculating stock-based compensation \\nexpense requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the options, stock price volatility, and the \\npre-vesting forfeiture rate. We estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns, which we utilize \\nas the means of estimating future behavior. Because our stock only became publicly traded in December 2014, we do not have \\nenough data upon which to estimate volatility based on historical performance. We estimate the volatility of our common stock \\non the date of grant using historical data of public companies we judge to be reasonably comparable, e.g., companies in similar \\nindustries that recently completed initial public offerings of comparable size. In the near future, upon achieving a reasonable base \\nof historical performance data, we will utilize historical and/or implied volatility as part of our assumptions.\\n\\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates \\ninvolve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different \\nassumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to \\nestimate the expected pre-vesting award forfeiture rate, and recognize expense only for those options expected to vest. We estimate \\nthis forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock-based awards that are granted and canceled before vesting. If our \\nactual forfeiture rate is materially different from our original estimates, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly \\ndifferent from what we have recorded in the current period. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect \\non reported stock-based compensation expense, as the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all current and previously recognized \\nexpense for unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher \\nthan the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a \\ndecrease to the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated \\nforfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense \\nrecognized in our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the \\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss \\nand tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable \\nincome in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in \\ntax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We reduce \\nthe measurement of a deferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize \\nsome or all of the deferred tax asset.\\n\\nUncertain tax positions are recognized only when we believe it is more likely than not that the tax position will be upheld \\nupon examination by the taxing authorities based on the merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related \\nto unrecognized income tax uncertainties in income tax expense. We did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with \\nuncertain tax positions in any of the reporting periods included in this report.\\n\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and JOBS Act Election\\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\n\\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue Recognition, which creates ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with \\nCustomers, and supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires revenue to be recognized in an amount that \\nreflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services as described in ASU 2014-09.  \\nIn July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The new guidance will be \\neffective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. \\nEarly adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016.  We completed our assessment of \\nthe impact of the new revenue standard noting that revenue generated in accordance with ASC 310, Receivables, and ASC 860, \\nTransfers and Servicing, is explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606.  Accordingly, we have concluded that our interest \\nincome, gains on loan sales and loan servicing income will not be effected by the adoption of ASC 606.  Marketing fees from our \\nissuing bank partner will be within the scope of ASC 606.  However, we believe that ASC 606 will have little, if any, impact on \\nthe timing and amount of revenue recognition as compared to the current guidance. We will adopt the requirements of the new \\nstandard effective January 1, 2018 and intend to apply the modified retrospective method of adoption.  We do not expect a material \\nimpact from the adoption of ASC 606 and do not expect to record a cumulative effect at the date of initial application.\\n\\n\\n\\n76\\n\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which creates ASC 842, Leases, and supersedes ASC 840, Leases.  \\nASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. \\nRecognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease.  The new \\nguidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that \\nreporting period and is applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact \\nthe adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 \\nwill change the impairment model and how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets. The standard requires \\nentities to use the new expected credit loss impairment model which will replace the incurred loss model used today. The new \\nstandard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, but not \\nprior to December 15, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our \\nconsolidated financial statements.\\n\\nJOBS Act\\n\\nUnder the JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an “emerging growth company.” We have irrevocably elected to opt out of \\nthe extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS \\nAct.\\n\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\n\\nMarket risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a \\nfinancial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, \\ncommodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and \\nforeign currency exchange rates. \\n\\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\\n\\nOur cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 consisted of cash maintained in several FDIC insured operating \\naccounts, which may exceed FDIC insured amounts. Our primary exposure to market risk for our cash and cash equivalents is \\ninterest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Given the currently low U.S. \\ninterest rates, we generate only a de minimis amount of interest income from these deposits.\\n\\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our debt agreements which are subject to variable \\ninterest rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had $397.7 million of outstanding borrowings under debt agreements with variable \\ninterest rates. An increase of one percentage point in interest rates would result in an approximately $4.0 million increase in our \\nannual interest expense on our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2017.  Any debt we incur in the future may also bear \\ninterest at variable rates. Any increase in interest rates in the future will likely affect our borrowing costs under all of our sources \\nof capital for our lending activities.\\n\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\n\\nSubstantially all of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result of our Canadian operations \\nand our growing Australia operations, as of December 31, 2017, we are subject to greater foreign currency exchange rate risk as \\ncompared to December 31, 2016. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the possibility that our financial position or results of \\noperations could be positively or negatively impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. We are currently exploring the feasibility \\nof an expanded hedging program which may include natural hedges as well as derivative instruments such as forwards, options \\nand/or swaps. To date, such hedging has not been material. We intend to enter into these transactions only to hedge underlying \\nrisk reasonably related to our business and not for speculative purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\n77\\n\\nItem 8.

In our opinion, \\nthe consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December \\n31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December \\n31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \\n\\nBasis for Opinion \\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company \\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in \\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission \\nand the PCAOB. \\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error \\nor fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial \\nreporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for \\nthe purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, \\nwe express no such opinion.  \\n\\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due \\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, \\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting \\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial \\nstatements.

Organization\\n\\nOn Deck Capital, Inc.’s principal activity is providing financing to small businesses located throughout the United States \\nas well as Canada and Australia, through term loans and lines of credit. We use technology and analytics to aggregate data about \\na business and then quickly and efficiently analyze the creditworthiness of the business using our proprietary credit-scoring model.  \\nWe originate most of the loans in our portfolio and also purchase loans from an issuing bank partner. We subsequently transfer \\nmost of our loan volume into one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries or sell them through OnDeck Marketplace®.  \\n\\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\\n\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements and footnotes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted \\nin the United States of America, or GAAP as contained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting \\nStandards Codification, or ASC. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain \\nreclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.  When used in these notes \\nto consolidated financial statements, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or similar terms refers to On Deck Capital, Inc. and its consolidated \\nsubsidiaries.\\n\\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we acquired a 55% interest in On Deck Capital Australia PTY LTD, or OnDeck Australia, \\nwith the remaining 45% owned by unrelated third parties. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2015, we acquired a 67% interest \\nin an entity with the remaining 33% owned by an unrelated third party strategic partner for the purpose of providing small business \\nloans to customers of the third party. In the second quarter of 2017, we ceased the operations of this entity.  We consolidate the \\nfinancial position and results of operations of these entities. The noncontrolling interest, which is presented as a separate component \\nof our consolidated equity, represents the minority owners\\' proportionate share of the equity of the jointly owned entities. The \\nnoncontrolling interest is adjusted for the minority owners\\' share of the earnings, losses, investments and distributions.\\n\\nSegment Reporting\\n\\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is \\nevaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial \\nperformance. Based upon the way our CODM reviews financial information and makes operating decisions and considering that \\nour CODM reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial \\nperformance, our operations constitute a single operating segment and one reportable segment. Substantially all revenue was \\ngenerated and all assets were held in the United States during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect \\nthe reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates include allowance \\nfor loan losses, stock-based compensation expense, servicing assets/liabilities, loans purchased, capitalized software development \\ncosts, the useful lives of long-lived assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical \\nexperience, current events and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions \\nare inherently subjective in nature; actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents include checking, savings and money market accounts. We consider all highly liquid investments \\nwith original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\\n\\nRestricted Cash\\n\\nRestricted cash represents funds held in accounts as reserves on certain debt facilities and as collateral for issuing bank \\npartner transactions.  We have no ability to draw on such funds as long as they remain restricted under the applicable \\narrangements\\n\\n\\n\\n85\\n\\nLoans Held for Investment and Loans Held for Sale\\n\\nLoans Held for Investment\\n\\nLoans held for investment consist of term loans and lines of credit that require daily or weekly repayments. We have both \\nthe ability and intent to hold these loans to maturity. When we originate a term loan, the borrower grants us a security interest in \\nits assets which we may perfect by publicly filing a financing statement. Loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost, \\nreduced by a valuation allowance for loan losses estimated as of the balance sheet dates. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-20, \\nNonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, the amortized cost of a loan is equal to the unpaid principal balance, plus net deferred \\norigination costs. Net deferred origination costs are comprised of certain direct origination costs, net of all loan origination fees \\nreceived. Loan origination fees include fees charged to the borrower related to origination that increase the loan’s effective interest \\nyield. Loan origination costs are limited to direct costs attributable to originating a loan, including commissions and personnel \\ncosts directly related to the time spent by those individuals performing activities related to loan origination. Direct origination \\ncosts in excess of loan origination fees received are included in the loan balance and for term loans are amortized over the life of \\nthe term loan using the effective interest method, while for lines of credit principal amounts drawn are amortized using the straight-\\nline method over 6 months.\\n\\nWhen a term loan is originated in conjunction with the extinguishment of a previously issued term loan, also known as a \\nrenewal, we determine whether such subsequent term loan is a new loan or a modification to an existing loan in accordance with \\nASC 310-20. If accounted for as a new loan, any remaining unamortized net deferred costs are recognized when the new loan is \\noriginated. Further, when a renewal is accounted for as a new loan, the cash flows of the origination and related net deferred \\norigination costs of that new loan are presented as (i) operating cash outflows on the Statement of Cash Flows if the renewal is \\ndesignated to be sold or (ii) as investing cash outflows if the renewal is designated to be held for investment. If a renewal is \\naccounted for as a modification, any remaining unamortized net deferred costs are amortized over the life of the modified loan. \\nWhen a renewal is accounted for as a modification, the additional cash flows associated with the origination and related net deferred \\norigination costs of that modification are presented on the Statement of Cash Flows within the same section as the originally issued \\nterm loan prior to renewal.\\n\\nPurchase of Loans\\n\\nFrom time to time, we may purchase loans that we previously sold to third parties. We generally determine the price we are \\nwilling to pay for those loans through arm\\'s-length negotiations and by using a discounted cash flow model that contains certain \\nunobservable inputs such as discount rate, renewal rate and default rate, with adjustments that management believes a market \\nparticipant would consider. We may also obtain third-party valuations of pools of loans we are considering purchasing. Upon \\npurchase, loans are recorded at their acquisition price which represents fair value. The amortized cost of the purchased loans, \\nwhich includes unpaid principal balances and any related premiums or discounts, when applicable, are included in loans held for \\ninvestment on the consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nLoans Held for Sale\\n\\nOnDeck Marketplace is our proprietary whole loan sale platform whereby we sell certain term loans to third-party institutional \\ninvestors and retain the related servicing rights. We sell these whole loans to purchasers in exchange for a cash payment. A loan \\nis initially classified as held for sale when the whole loan is identified for sale and a plan exists for the sale. A loan that is initially \\ndesignated as held for sale or held for investment may be reclassified when our intent for that loan changes. When a loan held for \\nsale is reclassified to held for investment, the loan is recorded at amortized cost and a provision for loan loss is recorded. When \\na loan held for investment is reclassified to held for sale, any allowance for loan loss related to that loan is released. Loans held \\nfor sale, inclusive of net deferred origination costs, are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value until the loans are sold \\nor reclassified.  To determine the fair value of loans held for sale we utilize industry-standard modeling, such as discounted cash \\nflow models, to arrive at an estimate of fair value and may utilize third-party service providers to assist in the valuation process. \\n\\nServicing Rights\\n\\n We service loans that we have sold to third parties and upon such sale, we may recognize a servicing asset or liability, \\ncollectively referred to as servicing rights. Receiving more than adequate compensation, as defined by ASC Topic 860 Transfers \\nand Servicing, results in the recognition of a servicing asset. Receiving less than adequate compensation results in a servicing \\nliability. Servicing assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value and are presented as a component of other assets or accrued \\nexpenses and other liabilities, respectively. The initial recognition of a servicing asset results in a corresponding increase to gain \\non sales of loans. The initial recognition of a servicing liability results in a corresponding decrease to gain on sales of loans. \\nSubsequent adjustments to the fair value of servicing rights are recognized as an adjustment to other revenue.  The initial recognition \\nincludes both servicing rights resulting from transfers of financial assets and when applicable, changes in inputs or assumptions \\nused in the valuation model.\\n\\n\\n\\n86\\n\\nWe utilize industry-standard modeling, such as discounted cash flow models, to arrive at an estimate of fair value and may \\nutilize third-party service providers to assist in the valuation process. Significant assumptions used in valuing our servicing rights \\nare as follows:\\n\\n• Adequate compensation: We estimate adequate compensation as the rate a willing market participant would require to \\nservice loans with similar characteristics as those in the serviced portfolio. In the event of a lack of transparency and \\nquantity of transactions related to trades of servicing rights of comparable loans (i.e., loans with comparable terms, unpaid \\nprincipal balances, renewal rates and default rates) we may consider the actual cost incurred as a basis for determining \\nwhat a market participant would require to service the loans.\\n\\n• Discount rate: For servicing rights on loans, the discount rate reflects the time value of money and a risk premium intended \\nto reflect the amount of compensation market participants would require.\\n\\n• Renewal rate: We estimate the timing and probability that a borrower may renew their loan in advance of scheduled \\nrepayment, thus reducing the projected unpaid principal balance and expected term of the loan, which are used to project \\nfuture servicing revenues.\\n\\n• Default rate: We estimate the timing and probability of loan defaults and write-offs, thus reducing the projected unpaid \\nprincipal balance and expected term of the loan, which are used to project future servicing revenues.\\n\\nAllowance for Loan Losses\\n\\nThe allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) is established with respect to our loans held for investment through periodic charges \\nto the provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the ALLL when we believe that the future collection of principal \\nis unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ALLL.\\n\\nWe evaluate the creditworthiness of our portfolio on a pooled basis due to its composition of small, homogeneous loans \\nwith similar general credit risk characteristics and diversification among variables including industry and geography. We use a \\nproprietary forecasted loss rate at origination for new loans that have not had the opportunity to make payments when they are \\nfirst funded. The forecasted loss rate is updated daily to reflect actual loan performance and the underlying ALLL model is updated \\nmonthly to reflect our assumptions. The allowance is subjective as it requires material estimates, including such factors as historical \\ntrends, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers’ ability to repay and current \\neconomic conditions. Other qualitative factors considered may include items such as uncertainties in forecasting and modeling \\ntechniques, changes in portfolio composition, business conditions and emerging trends. Recovery of the carrying value of loans \\nis dependent to a great extent on conditions that may be beyond our control. Any combination of the aforementioned factors may \\nadversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies and loan losses and could require additional provisions for \\ncredit losses, which could impact future periods.  \\n\\nAccrual for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\\n\\nFor our lines of credit, we estimate probable losses on unfunded loan commitments similarly to the ALLL process and \\ninclude the calculated amount in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We believe the accrual for unfunded loan commitments \\nis sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to these unfunded credit commitments. The determination of the adequacy \\nof the accrual is based on evaluations of the unfunded credit commitments, including an assessment of the probability of commitment \\nusage, credit risk factors for lines of credit outstanding to these customers and the terms and expiration dates of the unfunded \\ncredit commitments. \\n\\nAccrual for Third-Party Representations\\n\\nWe have made certain representations to third parties that purchase loans through OnDeck Marketplace.  Our obligations \\nunder those representations are not secured by escrows or similar arrangements.  However, if we determine it is probable that \\nrepresentations may be breached, we could be required to accrue certain liabilities. Any significant estimated post-sale obligations \\nor contingent obligations to the purchaser of the loans, such as loan repurchase obligations or excess loss indemnification \\nobligations, would be accrued if probable and estimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies. There are no restricted assets \\nrelated to these agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have not incurred any significant losses and/or material \\nliability for probable obligations requiring accrual.\\n\\nNonaccrual Loans, Restructured Loans and Charged-Off Loans\\n\\nWe consider a loan to be delinquent when the daily or weekly payments are one day past due. We place loans on nonaccrual \\nstatus and stop accruing interest income on loans that are delinquent and non-paying. Loans are returned to accrual status if they \\nare brought to non-delinquent status or have performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time \\nand, in our judgment, will continue to make periodic principal and interest payments as scheduled.\\n\\n\\n\\n87\\n\\nCertain borrowers who have experienced or are expected to experience financial difficulty may not be able to maintain their \\nregularly scheduled and contractually required payments. Following discussions with us, such borrowers may temporarily make \\nreduced payments and/or make payments on a less frequent basis than contractually required. As part of our effort to maximize \\nloan recoverability and as a temporary accommodation to the borrower, we may voluntarily forebear from pursuing our legal rights \\nand remedies under the applicable loan agreement, which loan agreement we do not modify and which remains in full force and \\neffect.\\n\\nGenerally, after the 90th day of delinquency, we will make an initial assessment of whether an individual loan should be \\ncharged off based on payment status and information gathered through collection efforts. A loan is charged off when we determine \\nit is probable that we will be unable to collect all of the remaining principal payments.\\n\\nDeferred Debt Issuance Costs and Debt\\n\\nWe borrow from various lenders to finance our lending activities and general corporate operations. Costs incurred in \\nconnection with financings, such as banker fees, origination fees and legal fees, are classified as deferred debt issuance costs. We \\ncapitalize these costs and amortize them over the expected life of the related financing agreements. The related fees are expensed \\nimmediately upon early extinguishment of the debt. In a debt modification, the initial issuance costs and any additional fees \\nincurred as a result of the modification are deferred over the term of the modified agreement.  Deferred debt issuance costs are \\namortized using the effective interest method for term debt and the straight-line method for revolving lines of credit. Interest \\nexpense and the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs incurred on debt used to fund loan originations are presented as \\nfunding costs in our consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense and the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs \\nincurred on debt used to fund general corporate operations are recorded as interest expense, a component of other expense, in our \\nconsolidated statements of operations.  Deferred debt issuance costs are presented as a reduction of debt in accordance with ASU \\n2015-03, Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  Refer to Recently \\nAdopted Accounting Standards for additional details.\\n\\nProperty, Equipment and Software\\n\\nProperty, equipment and software consists of computer and office equipment, purchased software, capitalized internal-use \\nsoftware costs and leasehold improvements. Property, equipment and software are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation \\nand amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense are recognized over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the \\nstraight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the terms of the respective leases or the estimated \\nlives of the improvements.\\n\\nIn accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-40, Internal-Use Software, we begin to capitalize the costs to develop software for \\nour website and other internal uses when the following criteria are met: (i) the preliminary project stage is completed (ii) we have \\nauthorized funding (iii) it is probable that the project will be completed and (iv) we conclude that the software will perform the \\nfunction intended. Capitalized internal-use software costs primarily include salaries and payroll-related costs for employees directly \\ninvolved in the development efforts, software licenses acquired and fees paid to outside consultants.\\n\\nSoftware development costs incurred prior to meeting the criteria for capitalization and costs incurred for training and \\nmaintenance are expensed as incurred. Certain upgrades and enhancements to existing software that result in additional functionality \\nare capitalized. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over their expected useful \\nlives, which is generally three years.\\n\\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values \\nof those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is \\nnot recoverable and exceeds its fair market value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows \\n(undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If an impairment is \\ndetermined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair \\nvalue and recorded in the period the determination is made. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount \\nor fair value, less costs to sell. \\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nInterest Income\\n\\nWe generate revenue primarily through interest and origination fees earned on loans originated and held to maturity.\\n\\nFor term loans, we recognize interest and origination fee revenue over the terms of the underlying loans using the effective \\ninterest method. For lines of credit, we recognize interest income when earned in accordance with terms of the contract.  Origination \\nfees collected but not yet recognized as revenue are netted with direct origination costs and presented as a component of loans in \\nour consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\n\\n\\n88\\n\\nHistorically, borrowers who elected to prepay term loans were required to pay future interest and fees that would have been \\nassessed had the term loan been repaid in accordance with its original agreement. Beginning in December 2014, certain term loans \\nmay be eligible for a discount of future interest and fees that would have been assessed had the loan been repaid in accordance \\nwith its original agreement.\\n\\nGain on Sales of Loans\\n\\nWe account for OnDeck Marketplace loan sales in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, which states \\nthat a transfer of a financial asset, a group of financial assets, or a participating interest in a financial asset is accounted for as a \\nsale if all of the following conditions are met:\\n \\n\\n1. The financial assets are isolated from the transferor and its consolidated affiliates as well as its creditors.\\n\\n2. The transferee or beneficial interest holders have the right to pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets.\\n\\n3. The transferor does not maintain effective control of the transferred assets.\\n\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, all sales met the requirements for sale treatment in accordance \\nwith ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. We record the gain or loss on the sale of a loan at the sale date in an amount equal \\nto the proceeds received, adjusted for initial recognition of servicing assets or liabilities obtained at the date of sale, less outstanding \\nprincipal and net deferred origination costs.  A change in inputs or assumptions used in the valuation model related to servicing \\nassets or liabilities is recognized as a component of gain on sales of loans.\\n\\nOther Revenue\\n\\nOther revenue includes servicing revenue related to loans serviced for others, fair value adjustments to servicing rights, \\nplatform fees, monthly fees charged to customers for our line of credit, and marketing fees earned from our issuing bank partner, \\nwhich are recognized as the related services are provided. \\n\\nStock-Based Compensation\\n\\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, all stock-based compensation provided to \\nemployees, including stock options and restricted stock units, or RSU\\'s, is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the \\nawards and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which the award holder is required \\nto perform services in exchange for the award (the vesting period).  The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-\\nScholes-Merton Option Pricing Model. The use of the option valuation model requires subjective assumptions, including the fair \\nvalue of our common stock, the expected term of the option and the expected stock price volatility, which is based on our stock \\nas well as our peer companies. RSU\\'s issued to employees and directors are measured based on the fair values of the underlying \\nstock on the dates of grant. Additionally, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense requires an estimation of the number \\nof options and RSUs that will ultimately be forfeited. Estimated forfeitures are subsequently adjusted to reflect actual forfeiture.\\n\\nOptions typically vest at a rate of 25% after one year from the vesting commencement date and then monthly over an \\nadditional three-year period. The options expire ten years from the grant date or, for terminated employees, 90 days after the \\nemployee’s termination date.  RSUs typically vest at a rate of 25% annually, over four annual vesting periods. Compensation \\nexpense for the fair value of the options and RSUs at their grant date is recognized ratably over the vesting period.\\n\\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\\n\\nIn the third quarter of 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved performance-based \\ncompensation awards to certain members of executive management and other key personnel. The performance-based compensation \\nawards consist of performance-based restricted stock units, or PRSUs, to be settled solely in shares of our common stock, as well \\nas performance units, to be settled solely in cash. The value of the awards is based on achieving a target performance level \\nestablished by the Compensation Committee and the award value may increase or decrease based on actual performance relative \\nto the target level. The compensation expense related to the PRSUs and performance units will be recorded on a straight-line basis \\nwith the expense being adjusted prospectively as our estimate of the expected performance is reassessed each reporting period.\\n\\nAdvertising Costs\\n\\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included within sales and marketing in our consolidated statements of \\noperations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, advertising costs totaled $15.0 million, $20.1 million and \\n$22.5 million, respectively.\\n\\nForeign Currency\\n\\nIn accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, we have determined the functional currency of our subsidiary, \\nOnDeck Australia, is the Australian dollar. We translate the financial statements of this subsidiary to U.S. dollars using month-\\n\\n\\n\\n89\\n\\nend exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average exchange rates for revenue and expenses. Translation gains and losses \\nare recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders\\' equity. As of December 31, 2017 and \\n2016, we recorded a translation gain of $327,000 and a loss of $7,000, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, \\nand 2015, the remeasurement of transactions designated in currencies other than our functional currency resulted in a gain of $1.6 \\nmillion and $0.2 million, and a loss of $1.3 million respectively, and was recorded within general and administrative expenses in \\nour consolidated statements of operations. \\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nIn accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax \\nconsequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating \\nloss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in \\nwhich the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we \\nbelieve is more likely than not to be realized.\\n\\nUncertain tax positions are recognized only when we believe it is more likely than not that the tax position will be upheld \\non examination by the taxing authorities based on the merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related \\nto uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. We did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax \\npositions as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\\n\\nWe file income tax returns in the United States for federal, state and local jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. \\nfederal, certain states, and local income tax examinations for years prior to 2014, with certain states no longer subject for years \\nprior to 2013, although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to 2014 may still be adjusted upon examination by the \\nInternal Revenue Service if used in a future period. \\n\\nFair Value Measurement\\n\\nIn accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, we use a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all \\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-\\nrecurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires us to use observable inputs when \\navailable, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. The three tiers are defined as follows:\\n\\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets or liabilities in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at \\nthe measurement date.\\n\\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or \\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\\n\\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop \\nour own assumptions. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of inputs that market participants would use in \\npricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flows, or similar \\ntechniques, which incorporate our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument \\nor valuations that require significant management judgment or estimation.\\n\\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant \\nto the fair value measurement.\\n\\nBasic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share\\n\\nBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to On Deck Capital, Inc. common stockholders \\nby the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive \\nsecurities. \\n\\nDiluted net loss per common share includes the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially \\ndilutive securities into common stock using the “treasury stock” or “if converted” methods, as applicable. Diluted net loss per \\ncommon share is computed by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus, for periods with net \\nincome attributable to common stockholders, the potential dilutive effects of stock options, warrants and unvested restricted stock.  \\nDue to net losses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, basic and diluted net loss per common share were the \\nsame, as the effect of potentially dilutive securities was anti-dilutive.\\n\\n\\n\\n90\\n\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\\n\\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2015-03, Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic \\n835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The ASU simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by \\nrequiring that unamortized debt issuance costs be presented as a reduction of the applicable liability rather than an asset. The \\nguidance was effective on January 1, 2016 and was required to be applied retrospectively. Accordingly, $4.2 million of deferred \\ndebt issuance costs on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been reclassified to be presented as a reduction \\nof the carrying value of the associated debt to conform with the current period presentation.\\n\\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 \\nwill simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions which include the income tax consequences, \\nclassification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. \\nThe new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted \\nin any interim or annual period. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial \\nstatements.\\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted as of December 31, 2017\\n\\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue Recognition, which creates ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with \\nCustomers, and supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires revenue to be recognized in an amount that \\nreflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services and also requires additional \\ndisclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from customer contracts. The new guidance \\nwill be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting \\nperiod. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In March 2016, the FASB \\nissued ASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations, which makes amendments to the new revenue standard on assessing \\nwhether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction and impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or \\nnet basis. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which makes \\namendments to the new revenue standard regarding the identification of performance obligations and accounting for the license \\nof intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, \\nwhich makes amendments to the new revenue standard regarding assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash \\nconsideration and completed contracts and contract modifications at the time of transition to the new standard. Each amendment \\nhas the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue recognition standard. We completed our assessment \\nof the impact of the new revenue standard noting that revenue generated in accordance with ASC 310, Receivables, and ASC 860, \\nTransfers and Servicing, is explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606.  Accordingly, we have concluded that our interest \\nincome, gains on loan sales and loan servicing income will not be effected by the adoption of ASC 606.  Marketing fees from our \\nissuing bank partner will be within the scope of ASC 606.  However, we believe that ASC 606 will have little, if any, impact on \\nthe timing and amount of revenue recognition as compared to the current guidance. We adopted the requirements of the new \\nstandard effective January 1, 2018 and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption.  The adoption of ASC 606 did not \\nhave a material effect and we did not record a cumulative effect at the date of initial application.  \\n\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which creates ASC 842, Leases, and supersedes ASC 840, Leases. \\nASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. \\nRecognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. The new \\nguidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that \\nreporting period and is applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption \\nof this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 will \\nchange the impairment model and how entities measure credit losses for most financial assets. The standard requires entities to \\nuse the new expected credit loss impairment model which will replace the incurred loss model used today. The new guidance will \\nbe effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, but not prior to December \\n15, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n\\n\\n91\\n\\n3.

(\"PORT Agreement\"). The facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%, and was to mature in \\nJune 2017.  In December 2016, we voluntarily paid down the funding debt outstanding with this facility in conjunction with the \\nentering into of the PORT II Agreement.  The remaining unamortized deferred issuance costs related to the PORT Agreement of \\n$0.2 million were written-off and are included within Funding Costs.\\n\\nRAOD Agreement\\n\\nOn May 22, 2015, through a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary, we entered into a $50 million revolving line of \\ncredit with SunTrust Bank (\"RAOD Agreement\"). The facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%, and matures in May 2017. On \\nFebruary 26, 2016, the RAOD Agreement was amended to increase the borrowing capacity from $50 million to $100 million. On \\nMay 25, 2017, we renewed the RAOD facility with amended terms which provided for an extension of the revolving commitment \\nperiod to November 22, 2018; a decrease in the interest rate to LIBOR + 2.5% from LIBOR + 3.0%; and various technical, \\ndefinitional, conforming and other changes.\\n\\nODAC Agreement\\n\\n On May 22, 2015, amendments were made to the ODAC Agreement to, among other items, extend the commitment \\ntermination date to May 2017 and to provide for the utilization of up to the entire ODAC facility solely for the financing of our \\nline of credit.  In addition to other changes, this facility is now exclusively used to our line of credit. On April 28, 2016, we amended \\nthe ODAC Agreement to increase the revolving commitment from an aggregate amount of $50 million to $75 million, increase \\nthe interest rate from LIBOR plus 8.25% to LIBOR plus 9.25%, increase in the borrowing base advance rate from 70% to 75% and \\nmake certain other related changes. On May 4, 2017, we renewed the ODAC facility with amended terms, which provided for an \\nincrease in the revolving commitments from $75 million to 100 million and an extension of the revolving commitment period to \\nMay 3, 2019. The interest rate decreased to LIBOR (minimum of 0.75%) + 7.25% from LIBOR (minimum of 0.0%) + 9.25% and \\nthe advance rate increased from 75% to 85%.\\n\\nODAST II Agreement\\n\\nOn May 17, 2016, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, OnDeck Asset Securitization Trust II LLC, or the ODAST II, \\nentered into a $250 million asset-backed securitization facility with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as indenture trustee. \\nThe notes under the facility were issued in two classes; Class A in the amount of $211.5 million and Class B in the amount of $38.5 \\nmillion. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.21% and 7.63%, respectively. Interest only payments began \\nin June 2016 and are payable monthly through May 2018. Beginning June 2018, monthly payments will consist of both principal \\nand interest with a final maturity of May 2020. Concurrent with the closing of the ODAST II securitization, we voluntarily prepaid \\nin full $175 million of funding debt outstanding from our prior asset-backed securitization transaction, or the ODAST Agreement. \\n\\nODART Agreement\\n\\nOn October 7, 2015 an amendment was made to the ODART Agreement which included an amendment for a decrease in \\nClass A interest rate to the applicable cost of funds rate plus 2.25%, the extension of the commitment termination date of the \\nODART Agreement by approximately one year to September 15, 2017, the extension of the date on or prior to which early \\ntermination fees may be payable in the event of a termination or other permanent reduction of the revolving commitments by \\napproximately one year to May 15, 2017, and the ability to make certain partial commitment terminations without early termination \\nfees, the ability to use up to a specified portion of the facility for financing of our weekly pay term loans and, the termination of \\nthe Class B revolving lending commitment, the effect of which is to reduce the total facility capacity to $150 million; the termination \\nwas made at ODART\\'s request and consented to by the Class B Revolving Lender. The ODART Second A&R Credit Agreement \\nalso contemplates the reintroduction, at ODART\\'s election and administrative agent\\'s consent, of one or more Class B Revolving \\nLending resulting in Class B commitments up to $17.6 million, thereby potentially restoring the facility size to up to$167.6 million. \\nThe borrowing base advance rate for reintroduced Class B revolving loans is 95% and the interest rate will be LIBOR plus 7.00%.\\n\\nOn June 17, 2016 an amendment was made to the ODART Agreement, to reintroduce Class B revolving loans from the Class \\nB Revolving Lender resulting in additional funding capacity of $12.4 million, thereby increasing the total revolving commitment \\nfrom $150 million to $162.4 million, establishing a Class B interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 8%, a borrowing base advance rate \\nfor the Class B revolving loans of 92% and make certain other changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n96\\n\\nOn March 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment and restatement of the ODART Agreement which provided for a $50 \\nmillion increase in the maximum amount of the Class A revolving loans and an increase up to $1.8 million in the maximum amount \\nof the Class B revolving loans, thereby increasing the total facility size up to $214.1 million, an extension of the revolving \\ncommitment period during which ODART may utilize funding capacity under the Deutsche Bank Facility to March 20, 2019, a \\nborrowing base advance rate for the Class A revolving loans of 85% and a borrowing base advance rate for the Class B revolving \\nloans of 91% ; and various technical, definitional, conforming and other changes.\\n\\nODAF Agreement\\n\\nOn August 19, 2016, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a $100 million asset-backed revolving debt facility, \\nor the ODAF Agreement. The commitment bears interest at LIBOR plus 7.25%, has a borrowing base advance rate of up to 80% and \\nmatures in August 2019. On February 14, 2017, we entered into an amendment of the ODAF I Agreement which provided for an \\nincrease in the Lenders\\' revolving commitment from an aggregate amount of $100 million to $150 million, the extension of the \\nrevolving commitment termination date by approximately six months to February 14, 2019, and various technical, definitional, \\nconforming and other changes.\\n\\nPORT II Agreement\\n\\nOn December 8, 2016, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a $200 million (consisting of $125 million Class \\nA commitments, with the Class A Lenders having the ability to, in their sole discretion and on an uncommitted basis, make \\nadditional Class A loans of up to $75 million) asset-backed revolving debt facility, or the PORT II Agreement. The commitment \\nbears interest at a specified base rate, generally the daily CP rate, plus 2.25% (Class A), has a borrowing base advance rate of \\n83% and matures in December 2018.  Concurrent with the closing of the PORT II revolving debt facility, we voluntarily prepaid \\nin full funding debt outstanding from another asset-backed revolving debt facility, the PORT Agreement.\\n\\nSquare 1 Agreement\\n\\nWe amended and restated this revolving debt facility in November 2014 to (i) extend its maturity date to October 2015; \\n(ii) decrease the interest rate to prime plus 1.25%, with a floor of 4.5% per annum; and (iii) increase our borrowing capacity to \\n$20 million. On October 2, 2015 an amendment was made to the Square 1 Agreement which extended the date of maturity of \\nour corporate revolving line of credit from October 2015 to October 2016, added a minimum monthly interest payment and \\nmodified certain financial and portfolio covenants.  In November 2016 we amended the Square 1 Agreement to increase the \\nrevolving commitment from an aggregate amount of $20 million to $30 million while also extending the maturity to October \\n2018.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2017, future maturities of our borrowings were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2018 $ 277,642\\n2019 297,938\\n2020 122,863\\n2021 —\\nThereafter —\\n\\nTotal $ 698,443\\n\\n\\n\\n97\\n\\n9.

A reconciliation of the difference between the \\nprovision for income taxes and income taxes at the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate is as follows for the years ended \\nDecember 31:\\n \\n\\n2017 2016 2015\\n\\nFederal statutory rate 34.0 % 34.0 % 34.0 %\\nEffect of:\\nChange in valuation allowance (34.5)% (36.5)% (28.0)%\\nFederal effect of change in state and local tax valuation allowance 0.5 % 2.5 % (6.0)%\\nIncome tax provision effective rate — % — % — %\\n\\nThe significant components of our deferred tax asset were as follows as of December 31 (in thousands):\\n \\n\\n2017 2016\\n\\nDeferred tax assets relating to:\\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 20,476 $ 25,880\\nLoan loss reserve 27,186 40,897\\nImputed interest income 424 800\\nDeferred rent 1,892 2,670\\nMiscellaneous items 45 174\\n\\nTotal gross deferred tax assets 50,023 70,421\\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\n\\nInternally developed software 3,912 2,224\\nProperty, equipment and software 4,242 6,747\\nOrigination costs 4,078 7,417\\nMiscellaneous items 40 430\\n\\nTotal gross deferred tax liabilities 12,272 16,818\\nNet deferred tax asset 37,751 53,603\\nLess: valuation allowance (37,751) (53,603)\\nNet deferred tax asset less valuation allowance $ — $ —\\n\\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all \\nof the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of \\nfuture taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled \\nreversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and planned tax strategies in making this assessment. Based \\nupon the level of historical losses and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are \\ndeductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences in the future. \\nTherefore, we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset.\\n\\nDeductions that are not deemed more likely than not to withstand examination by a taxing authority are considered to be \\n\"uncertain tax positions\" as defined in ASC 740 Income Taxes.  Prior to January 1, 2016, we had not recognized any uncertain tax \\npositions.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we claimed deductions on our U.S. federal tax return for certain expenses \\nrelated to our initial public offering that were validated at the level of substantial authority, but did not exceed the \"more likely \\nthan not\" threshold.  We estimate the tax-effected exposure of these deductions to be approximately $2.2 million. These deductions \\ndid not result in any change to our tax payable or our provision for income taxes, both of which were $0 as of and for the year \\nended December 31, 2017. These deductions will increase our deferred tax asset as well as the corresponding valuation allowance. \\nThere will be no financial statement benefit derived from this additional deferred tax asset until such time as the valuation allowance \\nis released.\\n\\n\\n\\n98\\n\\nOur net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately $82.1 million, $69.7 million and \\n$50.6 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and, if not utilized, will expire at various dates beginning in \\n2029. State net operating loss carryforwards were $81.3 million, $68.9 million and $49.8 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and \\n2015, respectively. Net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards reflected above may be limited due to historical \\nand future ownership changes.\\n\\nRecently Enacted Tax Reform Bill\\n\\n On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act, was signed into U.S. law and included numerous provisions \\nthat significantly revise existing tax law. The Tax Act introduces changes, including the reduction of the corporate income statutory \\ntax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, an increase in bonus depreciation and the deductibility \\nof certain depreciable assets, limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense, changes to net operating loss carryover and \\ncarryback rules, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and reductions in \\nthe amount of executive pay that could qualify as a tax deduction.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Tax \\nAct on its consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax \\nCuts and Jobs Act, or SAB 118, to assist registrants in accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act specifically when an accounting \\nanalysis of the Tax Act is incomplete for registrant\\'s financial statements for the reporting period in which the Tax Act became \\nlaw.  SAB 118 permits us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the \\nenactment date.  In accordance with SAB 118, we have been able to reasonably estimate the effect the change in the corporate tax \\nrate will have on our deferred tax asset.  At December 31, 2017, our deferred tax asset has been provisionally remeasured and \\nadjusted by $18.8 million from $56.6 million to $37.8 million.  Because a full valuation allowance has been and will continue to \\nbe recorded against our deferred tax asset, an amount corresponding to the reduction of the deferred tax asset has been released \\nfrom the valuation allowance.  These two adjustments offset each other and result in no net impact to our results of operations.\\n\\n10. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\\n\\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\\n\\nWe evaluate our financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the \\nappropriate level at which to classify them for each reporting period.  Due to the lack of transparency and quantity of transactions \\nrelated to trades of servicing rights of comparable loans, we utilize an income valuation technique to estimate fair value. We utilize \\nindustry-standard modeling, such as discounted cash flow models, to arrive at an estimate of fair value and may utilize third-party \\nservice providers to assist in the valuation process. This determination requires significant judgments to be made.\\n\\nThe following tables present information about our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis as of December 31 (in thousands):\\n \\n\\n2017\\nDescription Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\\n\\nAssets:\\nServicing assets $ — $ — $ 154 $ 154\\n\\nTotal assets $ — $ — $ 154 $ 154\\n\\n2016\\nDescription Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\\n\\nAssets:\\nServicing assets $ — $ — $ 1,131 $ 1,131\\n\\nTotal assets $ — $ — $ 1,131 $ 1,131\\n\\nThere were no transfers between levels for the year ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.\\n\\n\\n\\n99\\n\\nThe following tables presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for certain of our \\nLevel 3 fair value measurement as of December 31:\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017\\nUnobservable input Minimum Maximum Weighted Average\\n\\nServicing assets Discount rate 30.00% 30.00% 30.00%\\nCost of service(1) 0.04% 0.13% 0.12%\\nRenewal rate 41.06% 51.83% 49.59%\\nDefault rate 10.63% 10.92% 10.70%\\n\\n(1) Estimated cost of servicing a loan as a percentage of unpaid principal balance.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2016\\nUnobservable input Minimum Maximum Weighted Average\\n\\nServicing assets Discount rate 30.00% 30.00% 30.00%\\nCost of service(1) 0.09% 0.14% 0.11%\\nRenewal rate 46.20% 56.54% 50.14%\\nDefault rate 10.32% 10.75% 10.48%\\n\\n(1) Estimated cost of servicing a loan as a percentage of unpaid principal balance.\\n\\nChanges in certain of the unobservable inputs noted above may have a significant impact on the fair value of our servicing \\nasset.

Due to the lack of transparency and comparable loans, we utilize an \\nincome valuation technique to estimate fair value. We utilize industry-standard modeling, such as discounted cash flow models, \\nto arrive at an estimate of fair value and may utilize third-party service providers to assist in the valuation process. This determination \\nrequires significant judgments to be made.

Fair value of our \\nfixed rate debt is based on a discounted cash flow model with an unobservable input of discount rate.

Stock-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans\\n\\nEquity incentives are currently issued to employees and directors in the form of stock options and RSUs under our 2014 \\nEquity Incentive Plan.  Our 2007 Stock Option Plan was terminated in connection with our Initial Public Offering (IPO).  \\nAccordingly, no additional equity incentives are issuable under this plan although it continues to govern outstanding awards granted \\nthereunder.

For each of the \\nthree annual performance periods, one-third (1/3) of the total PRSUs may vest depending upon achievement of performance-based \\ntargets. Participants have the ability to earn up to 150% of the baseline award based on certain levels of achievement in excess of \\nthe relevant target performance level or could earn less than the baseline award, or nothing at all, based on certain levels of \\nachievement below the relevant target performance level. Measurement of performance is based on a 12-month period ending \\nJune 30 of each year. The first tranche did not vest due to the performance-based targets not being achieved. The second tranche \\n\\n\\n\\n102\\n\\nwas granted with a grant date fair value of $4.67 during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Commitments and Contingencies\\n\\nLease Commitments\\nOperating Leases\\n\\nIn January 2013, we entered into an operating lease in Virginia for office space, which was amended in January 2015 (as \\namended, “Virginia Lease”) to extend the term of the lease and rent additional space. The Virginia Lease calls for monthly rental \\npayments of $65,000, subject to escalation, and provides for a rent holiday of approximately six months and an aggregate $1 \\nmillion leasehold improvement incentive.\\n\\nDuring 2014 and 2015, we amended the lease of our corporate headquarters in New York City (as amended, “New York \\nLease”) to extend the term of the lease and rent additional space.  We will occupy additional spaces under the New York Lease \\nincrementally, as spaces becomes available, at which time we will incur additional rent payments.  For all spaces delivered to us \\nunder the New York Lease as of December 31, 2017, our average monthly fixed rent payment will be approximately $0.5 million, \\nsubject to escalations. We are entitled to rent credits aggregating $3.8 million and a tenant improvement allowance not to exceed \\n$5.8 million for all spaces delivered to us under the New York Lease as of December 31, 2017. The New York Lease is expected \\nto terminate in December 2026.\\n\\nIn April 2015, we provided notice of termination to the landlord of one of our office spaces in Denver, Colorado (“Original \\nDenver Lease”) resulting in a termination fee of $0.4 million, which was included in general and administrative expenses for the \\nyear ended December 31, 2015. The lease on that office space (\"Original Denver Lease\") expired in January 2016. \\n\\n\\n\\n103\\n\\nIn June 2015, we entered into a sublease in Denver, Colorado (\"New Denver Lease\") as the subtenant. The New Denver \\nLease calls for an average monthly fixed rent payment of approximately $144,000. The New Denver Lease also provides for a \\nfour-month rent holiday and a tenant improvement allowance not to exceed $2.6 million and is scheduled to expire in April 2026.\\n\\nIn May 2017, we entered into an operating lease in Australia for office space. The Australia lease calls for an average monthly \\nfixed rent payment of approximately $34,000 and is scheduled to expire in July 2020.\\n\\nCertain of our leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a \\nstraight-line basis over the term of the lease and record the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent expense as \\ndeferred rent within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Improvements funded by tenant allowances are recorded \\nas leasehold improvements and depreciated over the improvements’ estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, whichever \\nis shorter. The incentive is recorded as deferred rent and amortized over the term of the lease.\\n\\nRent expense incurred totaled $7.1 million, $7 million, and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and \\n2015.\\n\\nLease Commitments\\n\\nAt December 31, 2017, future minimum lease commitments under operating and capital leases, net of sublease income of  \\n$1.4 million, for the remaining terms of the operating leases were as follows (in thousands):\\n \\n\\nFor the years ending December 31,\\n2018 $ 8,633\\n2019 9,225\\n2020 9,270\\n2021 9,192\\n2022 8,915\\nThereafter 33,497\\nTotal $ 78,732\\n\\nIn February 2018, we terminated an operating lease for certain property in New York.  Taking such termination into effect, our \\nminimum lease commitments would be reduced, in total, by approximately $17.5 million.\\n\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\n\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash \\nequivalents, restricted cash and loans. We hold cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in accounts at regulated domestic financial \\ninstitutions in amounts that exceed or may exceed FDIC insured amounts and at non-U.S. financial institutions where deposited \\namounts may be uninsured. We believe these institutions to be of acceptable credit quality and we have not experienced any related \\nlosses to date.\\n\\nWe are exposed to default risk on loans we originate and hold and that we purchase from our issuing bank partner. We perform \\nan evaluation of each customer\\'s financial condition and during the term of the customer\\'s loan(s), we have the contractual right \\nto limit a customer\\'s ability to take working capital loans or other financing from other lenders that may cause a material adverse \\nchange in the financial condition of the customer.\\n\\nConcentrations of Revenue\\n\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had one group of customers that accounted for approximately 13% of total \\nrevenue, which was recognized through gain on sales of loans.  \\n\\nThe top three states in which we, or our issuing bank partner, originated loans  were California, Florida, and Texas, representing \\napproximately 14%, 9%, and 9% of our total loan originations, respectively, in both 2017 and 2016.  These geographic concentrations \\nexpose us to risks associated with localized natural disasters, local political or economic forces as well as state-level regulatory \\nrisks.\\n\\nContingencies\\n\\n\\n\\n104\\n\\nFrom time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The results of such \\nmatters cannot be predicted with certainty. However, we believe that the final outcome of any such current matters will not result \\nin a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows.\\n\\n13. Quarterly Financial Information (unaudited)\\n\\nThe following table contains selected unaudited financial data for each quarter of 2017 and 2016. The unaudited information \\nshould be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. We believe that \\nthe following unaudited information reflects all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information \\nfor the periods presented.

Subsequent events\\n\\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017, we terminated our lease agreement with respect to a portion of our office space in New \\nYork.  In connection with the termination, we expect to record a net charge of approximately $3.2 million in the quarter ending \\nMarch 31, 2018 including a surrender fee of approximately $2.6 million. The net charge will include the surrender fee and \\napproximately $4.0 million related to the impairment of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets in the surrendered space, \\nwhich will be partially offset by other deferred credits.\\n\\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\n\\nNone.\\n\\n \\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\\n\\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief \\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the \\nperiod covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that \\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, \\nsummarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and \\nprocedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by \\nus in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to our management, \\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our \\nrequired disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any \\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the \\ndesired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible \\ncontrols and procedures.\\n\\nBased on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of \\nDecember 31, 2017, the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a \\nreasonable assurance level.\\n\\n\\n\\n105\\n\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\n  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for \\nthe Company as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.  The Company’s internal control over financial \\nreporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and \\neffected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \\n\\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of our assets;\\n\\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements \\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made \\nonly in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and \\n\\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition \\nof our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the \\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 using the criteria established \\nin  Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \\nCommission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment and those criteria, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial \\nOfficer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017 to provide \\nreasonable assurance of the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in \\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\n\\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm on our \\ninternal control over financial reporting due to an exemption established by the JOBS Act for \"emerging growth companies.\"\\n\\n Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 \\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\nItem 9B.
